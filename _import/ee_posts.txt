<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wilderdom/266650346/lightbox/" title="'Fear' by Jimee, Jackie, Tom &amp; Asha"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/84/266650346_5556348960.jpg" alt="&quot;'Fear' by Jimee, Jackie, Tom &amp; Asha&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>I had a really fun time the other night on the <a href="http://www.webosroundup.com/">webOSRoundup</a> live podcast recording. We do it over Skype + UStream, so folks in the chat can watch us while we dick around and try to fix technical issues. I love doing stuff like this because I get to act like I know what I&#8217;m talking about &#8211;&#160;it&#8217;s a lot like this blog in that respect.</p>

<p>One of the major topics of discussion was <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/twitter-development-talk/yCzVnHqHIWo/discussion">a recent announcement</a> to the Twitter developer community about the way users interact with Twitter, and where developers should focus their efforts. There were also updates to the API TOS, but that really didn&#8217;t change much. The &#8220;money quote&#8221; was in the letter, signed by Ryan Sarver, that went out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230;developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. &#160;The answer is no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While follow-up discussion has basically been Twitter employees saying &#8220;oh, we didn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t, just that you probably won&#8217;t make money doing it.&#8221; While the folks posting this probably believe that, I think the folks who actually control what Twitter does meant what was said. And what was said was &#8220;you should not make client apps,&#8221; and not &#8220;you probably won&#8217;t make money making client apps.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lot of people have asked if this means 3rd party client apps are <em>banned</em>. No, not at the moment. But Twitter&#8217;s overriding purpose is to make their investors money, and if it becomes more lucrative to ban 3rd party clients outright, or restrict API access to blessed or paying developers, I have no doubt the company will do so. People have short attention spans, and if Twitter is still around in 2 years, things may have changed enough where they don&#8217;t care so much that they can&#8217;t use Tweetdeck.</p>

<p>The second point that came up in this discussion was how this affects webOS. There is no official client on webOS, but there is a very active set of 3rd-party devs who work on clients, including myself with Spaz. Right now, I believe there&#8217;s no official client simply because Twitter doesn&#8217;t care about webOS. At the moment, webOS market share is too low to matter to them. When that changes, they will be more interested in it.</p>

<p>And rest assured, HP Palm wants an official client. It&#8217;s in a list of apps they want, like Netflix and Skype. If HP/P has to build it themselves and just have the approval of Twitter (Twitter certainly doesn&#8217;t build all their official clients in-house), they will &#8211;&#160;like they did with FaceBook.</p>

<p>What does that mean for the various independently-developed Twitter clients? Probably that they will need to be accept that their products will be niche. I&#8217;m speculating, but I suspect HP/P will not put much effort into promoting 3rd party clients. There&#8217;s a good chance an official Twitter app will be pre-installed as well, which means many (most?) users won&#8217;t bother looking in the App Catalog for another option.</p>

<p>Does that mean you&#8217;re screwed? No. But it means you&#8217;re gonna have to accept a role as a &#8220;hobbyist&#8221; rather than trying to make this your day job. <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html">As Alex Payne said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get cozy with [Twitter], or work at arm&#8217;s length. Operating in between the hobbyist and professional roles could be difficult, and developers may be understandably frustrated as they&#8217;re forced to rethink their projects and products</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose it&#8217;s possible that HP/P might pluck some lucky indie developer out of obscurity and bring them on to develop the official client. More power to that person if it happens. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy removing features from your client and making space for ads.</p>

<p>Me, I&#8217;ll keep making Spaz, and improving its interoperability with other microblogging systems like the StatusNet-based Identi.ca. I&#8217;ve never made money on Spaz, and I like it that way &#8212; it keeps me focused on doing the right thing, not what will improve my financial position.</p>

<p>Luckily I can do that, but not everyone can, and those webOS developers who rely on their Twitter apps for income would be well-advised to consider whether their want to tie their success to a single company anymore &#8212; a company with which they have no financial relationship, and one that has clearly stated their intent to control the end-user market.</p>

<p><a href="http://phpcon.org/" title="PHP Community Conference - April 21-22 - Nashville, TN"><img src="http://funkatron.com/images/phpcomcon.png" alt="PHP Community Conference" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing conferences since July of 2006, when I attended <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/muntoh/207352244/">OSCON in Portland, OR</a>. Since then I&#8217;ve been to 4 or 5 a year, mostly as a speaker (#humblebrag) but sometimes as an attendee plebian as well.  They have included joints like:</p>

<ul>
<li>OSCON</li>
<li><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a></li>
<li>SXSWi</li>
<li>php|tek &amp; works</li>
<li><a href="http://BrooklynBeta.org">Brooklyn Beta</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#8217;ve gotten to see quite a range of conferences, from 10,000 people at SXSW, to 150 people at Brooklyn Beta. And after several years of this, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that the best conferences are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intimate</li>
<li>Intelligent</li>
<li>Welcoming</li>
<li>Focus on sharing and learning from one another</li>
</ul>

<p>With conferences like this, there&#8217;s a lot less separation between speaker and attendee, which I like a lot. I personally LOVE jabbering with anyone who wants to hear me, so I love it when attendees come up and ask questions or share their own experiences with me. And this is a LOT easier at smaller conferences that actively encourage this kind of atmosphere.</p>

<p>Last year, I attended two conferences that met those criteria for me: Open Source Bridge and Brooklyn Beta. Both of them were small, volunteer-driven, not profit-motivated, and intimate. The people who attended were across the board there because they love what they do. They love making great things,  sharing what they create, and sharing <em>how</em> they create. And that&#8217;s why everyone was there.</p>

<p>So I am <em>very</em> excited that some dedicated folks are trying to bring this kind of experience to the PHP community. <strong><a href="http://phpcon.org/">The PHP Community Conference</a> on April 21-22 in Nashville, TN</strong> is going to be an intimate, friendly, intelligent conference for folks who use PHP. You&#8217;ll learn new stuff about a variety of topics, from technical PHP issues to open source community building.</p>

<p>Plus, how often do <a href="http://phpcon.org/speakers">speakers</a> like Rasmus Lerdorf, Andrei Zmievski, Lorna Mitchell and Terry Chay come to Nashville? For once you can attend a top-notch PHP conference that isn&#8217;t on the west coast or Chicago.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m speaking as well, but what I&#8217;m most excited about is being able to learn and share with other folks who love building things with PHP. <strong>I&#8217;m confident that this will be the best PHP conference of 2011</strong>. And I hope you&#8217;ll be there so I can meet you and talk about the awesome stuff <em>you&#8217;re</em> doing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkatron/5438859669/" title="Spaz webOS themes"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/5438859669_025c84cd93.jpg" alt="Spaz webOS themes" /></a></p>

<p>This year, while doing taxes, I put together numbers on the <a href="http://twitter.com/spaz/status/27732358526402560">out-of-pocket costs for maintaining Spaz</a>. These include VPSes on <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8e904a2b6e8cf17be5654da4d81432ddf0cd82d6">Linode</a> and Rackspace, and paid accounts on <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com">lighthouseapp.com</a>. As I posted on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since folks were asking, I received $353.84 in donations in 2010 vs the ~$1700.00 expenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve never deluded myself into thinking the Spaz Project was even a break-even proposition: I make enough money in my day job to put some into Spaz, and I never expected to get it back.  It&#8217;s fulfilling for me and worth the investment to provide a transparent, open option for microblogging users.</p>

<p>Still, many folks in the webOS community have encouraged me to consider putting out a pay-for version of Spaz that people can purchase as a way to support the project. I wasn&#8217;t really comfortable with just putting out an identical product like that, but I think I came up with a reasonable value-add: additional themes.</p>

<p>Most users don&#8217;t really care about additional themes in an app, but some people LOVE them. I&#8217;m one of those people. I&#8217;ve always intended to put out Spaz with multiple themes, but work on adding features and improving performance have had higher priority, so I never got around to implementing it.</p>

<p>Recently I finally finished up the theme switching code, and was able to create a new theme. I informally put out a beta with this theme, called &#8220;Clean.&#8221; I also received a theme from Spaz contributor <a href="http://twitter.com/tibfib">Will Honey</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/techjunky79">Bee Rad</a> that mirrors the look of his awesome new audio app <a href="http://kotoplayer.com/">Koto Player</a>.</p>

<p>So, my idea is to release a Spaz webOS &#8220;Special Edition&#8221; with at least 5 new themes (so 6 total, including the default &#8220;Dreadnaught&#8221; theme). This would be a pay-for download in the app catalog, probably for $2-3. Note that motivated individuals <em>would</em> be able to download and integrate themes themselves if they so desire, and all contributed themes in the Special Edition would be under a liberal license that&#8217;s compatible with Spaz&#8217;s &#8220;New BSD&#8221; license.</p>

<p>In addition, I will donate 50% of the revenue from the Spaz webOS Special Edition to <a href="http://twitter.com/webosinternals">@webosinternals</a>. Their tireless work has made the webOS developer community the most open, transparent, and <em>fun</em> in mobile dev. We need to support them so they can continue to be awesome.</p>

<p>One issue that will come up with having multiple versions of Spaz is cross-app launching integration. Apps in the catalog must have unique IDs, so the Special Edition will have a different appid than the &#8220;regular&#8221; Spaz. I&#8217;ll probably put out a simple code snippet that checks for each one, so app devs don&#8217;t have to manually try to support all three &#8212; that would suck.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in making a theme, all the info is available at <a href="http://help.getspaz.com/kb/mobile/creating-your-own-theme-for-spaz-webos">help.getspaz.com</a>.</p>

<div class="photo-credit"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devicer/42499708/">Photo by Wheezy Jefferson</a></div>

<p>So I&#8217;ll admit I sat through the entire event on two liveblogs. I&#8217;ve invested a bunch of time in webOS dev, and I really, really like the platform. This event would say a lot about the future direction of webOS. Hitting a home-run with the press would go a long way to ensuring the platform is around for a long time. So I was pretty interested.</p>

<p>My reaction, after chewing on it for an evening, is mixed at best. Some stuff was really encouraging, but vague information and poor, confusing messages continue to plague HP/Palm.</p>

<h3>New Hardware demos: (B)</h3>

<p>All the tech looks solid. The interaction between devices is impressive. The tablet looks great, the Pre 3 and Veer hit their markets solidly, and all 3 look powerful enough to run webOS properly.</p>

<p>This would be a slam-dunk A if we didn&#8217;t get the vague release timeframes that have plagued Palm in the past. &#8220;Summer&#8221; (in the northern hemisphere) gives us a timeframe between 3-7 months from now. And if we learned anything from the Pre launch, people forget quickly how awesome your stuff looked in a press event a couple months ago. Even on the short end, this seems contrary to HP&#8217;s proclamations that <a href="http://www.webosroundup.com/2011/01/hp-ceo-new-products-will-ship-a-few-weeks-after-feb-9-announcement/">&#8220;when HP makes announcements, it will be getting ready to ship&#8221;</a>. Based on past experience, it&#8217;s hard to believe HP/Palm will ship these devices in short order. I&#8217;d love to be wrong, though.</p>

<p>Also, no carriers were announced. That&#8217;s disappointing, and may indicate problems HP is having getting interest after the poor performance of the Pre and Pixi.</p>

<h3>New Software Partnerships: (B)</h3>

<p>Solid stuff. Skype is a big one, as is Kindle. Both are key apps that webOS has suffered without. The publisher partnerships are interesting, but it remains to be seen whether the concept apps turn into long-term publishing relationships. If Enyo comes through with its potential to be a <em>cross-platform</em> development framework, targeting an app for webOS will likely make more sense for big name third parties.</p>

<h3>Support for older devices: (F)</h3>

<p>HP really dropped the ball here. Not only did they go back on a promise to bring webOS 2.0 to the Pre and Pixi, they seemed unprepared with the news. It seems clear that not everyone was on the same page, and some Palm/HP employees weren&#8217;t even aware of this. In addition, no clear plan to make it up to loyal webOS users was presented.</p>

<p>This would be less of an issue if carriers had been announced. Folks stuck with a Sprint Pre would at least have a clear upgrade path that gets them on the 2.0 train. For now, it&#8217;s hard for them to be optimistic.</p>

<p>My personal experience (which might get me in trouble for saying, but c&#8217;est la vie): webOS 2.x runs pretty well on the Pre Plus. In some ways, the apparent performance is superior to 1.4.5. I&#8217;ve heard it runs poorly on the original Pre, though.</p>

<h3>Developer Info: (D)</h3>

<p>I was surprised at how short the developer presentation was last night. Enyo is exciting, no doubt &#8211;&#160;it&#8217;s a very solid framework that is far more flexible than Mojo, and allows for much better development workflows &amp; utilization of superior dev tools.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s awesome, but it also means that if you&#8217;ve invested a lot of time in Mojo dev (like me), you can just toss that out. There is no upgrade or conversion path. It&#8217;s completely different, and you&#8217;ll be writing your app from scratch. And whether Enyo can run on 1.4.5 devices (packaged with the app itself) is up in the air, so if you want to support the users you have now, you now have two codebases to maintain.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/webosinternals">@webosinternals on Twitter</a> asked a lot of questions last night about dev topics that remain unanswered. I&#8217;ll c+p here:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;No word on app catalog going global at the developer event?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No word on allowing hybrid apps into the app catalog at the developer event?&#8221; (was <a href="http://twitter.com/unwiredben/status/35591859564707840">answered via Twitter by @unwiredben</a>)</li>
<li>&#8220;No word from the PR folks about the 2.0 OTA broken promise at the developer event?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No word on how the palm profile works on multiple devices and the effect of that on app sales at the developer event?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No word on the fate of the mojo push messaging service at the developer event?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No word on whether HP is going to sell these new devices in other countries, or whether the release date hinges on US carrier acceptance?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>Even worse, devs I&#8217;ve spoken with <em>expect to be let down by HP/Palm</em> &#8211; they expect to get unclear, vague answers. Or silence.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I have to wonder how much effort HP is putting into webOS dev relations. I&#8217;ve dealt with the folks there and they&#8217;re stand-up people, but my general impression is that they&#8217;re hamstrung and unable to communicate clearly to webOS devs. This is the time dev relations needs to be at its strongest, most forward, and clearest. <strong>Making folks rely on casual Q&amp;A at social events, or catching Twitter posts is <em>not</em> how it should be done</strong>. If HP really wants a top notch dev program, they need to step up and fix this ASAP, or risk alienating their dev core.</p>

<p>If HP can get their communication problems sorted out and start being what I&#8217;d call &#8220;aggressively transparent&#8221; with its development community, I think we&#8217;ll get back on the right track. Here&#8217;s hoping.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear the community&#8217;s thoughts on how we could have handled this better.  Should it have been a part of the presentation (which would have taken away some of the Enyo sparkle we need to attract new developers)?  Formal Q&amp;A session?  Open forum thread?  Our challenge is that answers to a lot of these questions are a variation of &#8220;we don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; but we could at least provide some insight into where we are currently.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Dear Lisa,</p>

<p>webOS is a fantastic system. Agreed. 
The displayed and presented products look cool. Agreed.</p>

<p>The new framework must be a step forward - not my core area. Agreed.</p>

<p>The presentation was cool, albeit too long.</p>

<p>What is not acceptable: Not sticking to promises made.</p>

<p>1.Flash - that is an old story look it up.
2. 2.0 for all old devices - that was recently promised on dev day in Nov. 10.</p>

<p>Customers on the pre - pre + and pixi at least some feel like beta testers.</p>

<p>The presentation lacked two important parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Products should be available in a very short time after the presentation. The carriers had to be present. The pricing had to be told.</p></li>
<li><p>A promised software update should have gone online right at the start of the presntation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you can diggest the feedback.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me on precentral.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

Perhaps a post in the early access forum an hour or so BEFORE letting this info slip so we can at least chew on it for a while in private.</p>

<p>Basically, we got a bunch of rah-rah-rah new stuff!  Then we began realizing it&#8217;s new stuff later, nothing now.  AND THEN we got hammered with legacy devices getting shut out.  All in all a bad experience.</p>

<p>What I expected to hear:
- What about Enyo apps on older devices? This is an important point for our development strategy.
- What about a more detailed roadmap towards the new releases?
- What about innovations besides Enyo, e.g. regarding the app catalog?
- What about an international dev device program?</p>

<p>You announced the Enyo preview but it is still not available - that could have been better prepared.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the concern, Lisa.</p>

<p>I feel like this post has almost completely summed up my feelings as well. Personally, I would like to emphasize the distress that the upgrade-nix news has caused on the early-adopters who hadn&#8217;t heard any indication of the roadblock prior to the event. It has made the show completely bittersweet to my household (2 Sprint Pre minuses). Not only will we not be able receiving the highly-revered 2.1 update, but we have absolutely no indication of when Sprint will be selling a device which will get us there.</p>

<p>We are hardcore Sprint tenants and Hardcore (with a capitol H) webOS users, but to be told &#8220;the coming months&#8221; for an indefinite amount of &#8220;coming months&#8221;, only to be told my day-one (6/6/09) Palm Pre is dead to HP is completly and utterly disheartening - at best.</p>

<p>Honor the early-adopter and make the &#8220;path&#8221; a pleasant one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am saddened by this. I&#8217;ve had my Pre- since June of 2009. I am the type of person who upgrades my phone every year; 2010 was a wasted upgrade cycle. If I hadn&#8217;t been promised that my Pre- would get 2.0, I would have simply got a new phone and waited for the next generation (Pre 3). This, by far, isn&#8217;t something I can&#8217;t get over, but the Pre 3 needs to be released fast. The longer the wait, the more content Android users are going to become with their phones, and the more people that will be locked into Verizon iPhones. I know the webOS &#8220;strategy&#8221; is a long term plan for HP, but the longer it takes, the more other companies will start to mimic HP/Palm&#8217;s ideas and design and the advantage will have been lost. Ruby can make jokes about the Blackberry Playbook all he wants, fact is, most people have no clue that it &#8220;copied&#8221; webOS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve said all this to say, &#8220;this summer&#8221; is too long of a delay for the release of these products. Even if it is &#8220;this summer,&#8221; give us a release date! If an appealing Windows Phone is available before a release date of the Pre 3, I think I&#8217;ll buy it for the same reason I bought the original Pre ,which is for its outside of the box UI and overall structure. And, I&#8217;ll be confident that I&#8217;m with a company that can deliver - after all its Microsoft.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There were lots of lovely new devices and cool tech shown&#8230; but the release dates, followed by the &#8220;no 2.0&#8221; thing, has left me wondering just how many visitors the app catalog will be seeing in a months time. I do my development out of love but I, like many others, would like to see some return on that. Babies ain&#8217;t cheap!</p>

<p>In a nutshell - yesterday was both great and terrible. Really, why it wasn&#8217;t put off until HP had devices to sell is a complete mystery. I&#8217;m sure there must be good reason we&#8217;ll likely never know but it would&#8217;ve made for a very different day today indeed.</p>

<p>Roll on the summer!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Lisa: To speak directly to what dev reIations could have done better for this event: A formal Q&amp;A would have gone very far in addressing many of the concerns. A dev event without one tends to feel more like a presentation and less like a dialog, and developers really appreciate the dialog. Also, for those of us that may not be that good at formulating questions to ask until later, a formal Q&amp;A helps greatly since everyone can learn from the questions asked.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Lisa.</p>

<p>The thing here is that many of the most loyal Palm Pre users have always used the official Palm software, a thing that is somewhat easy to change thanks to Preware, but just to some extent.</p>

<p>With the advent of the no-2.0-for-older-devices news, we&#8217;ll just maybe see a reboot on the FrankenDoctor topic, and they&#8217;ll will surely succeed.  The Pre and Pre2 hardware are very similar, so people will just grab the newest Doctors, combine them with the Prerelease ones, and presto, instant 2.x for older devices.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that the devices indeed support 2.x (at least the Pluses, I haven&#8217;t had the chance to check it on a Minus), it works fine albeit with a few bugs that as I guess have been ironed for the official 2.1&#8230; I don&#8217;t know why you just can create the Doctors for Pre 2 and beyond, and with some few changes create the Pre/Pre+ Doctors, it really goes beyond me.</p>

<p>Slow? Bump it to 600 or even 720Ghz, all Pre&#8217;s and Pre+ support it!  Few memory?  Use compcache!!  For god&#8217;s sake, the community has done so much for the devices that you could just grab the kernel patches and slap them to the official Pre Doctors&#8230; :(</p>

<p>Sorry for the small rant, but I&#8217;m truly dissapointed&#8230; the way you should had handled this was:</p>

<ul>
<li>There will be no OTA updates because the filesystem gets changed and there&#8217;s no safe way for rezising partitions with no data loss.</li>
<li>There will be a messaging backup scheme (maybe with an offline usb java tool)</li>
<li>There will be a 2.1 Doctor for Pre&#8217;s/Pre minus which will support said tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this, it would be the developers task to handle the versions&#8230; checks in the code to see if the user is on 1.4.x or 2.x, and see if you can install a java or js service, etc, etc&#8230;  And tell the user: Your device can support this and that, but you have to do this to update it since it&#8217;s dangerous to do it OTA.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s what comes to my mind.  I really don&#8217;t like this situation, it just after my gf tried to update her Xperia X10 mini pro to Android 2.2 and we knew that Sony isn&#8217;t supporting that update (comes with flash and the capacity of installing apps directly to the SD - she already has exhausted the memory).</p>

<p>Please, please, please, reconsider the update for Pre/Pre+/Pixies, it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am very torn after yesterday. I love the new hardware overall (though you&#8217;ll never be able to convince me that losing the gesture area is a good thing,) but I am sick of waiting for it. The new hardware needs to be here NOW. I&#8217;m still on my original launch day Pre and it is hurting. My wife&#8217;s Pixi is dying and she has put off the hassle of exchanging it for a new phone on the hope of being able to pre-order a new phone yesterday. Not getting 2.x wouldn&#8217;t bother me at all if I could get a whole new phone before this summer. On top of that, we don&#8217;t even know which carrier(s) will have the new goodies, so we were left with more questions than answers.</p>

<p>As far as the developer questions, I understand showing off Enyo was the primary goal but I know Rod is not alone in wanting an answer on his questions. Perhaps before the next developer event there could be a way to submit specific questions or topics you want to see covered. Maybe let us vote on them and try to address the most popular ones. Of course some of them would be unknown or confidential but at least it would give you a feel for which issues the community (including those who couldn&#8217;t be at the event in person) considers to be most relevant.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My major frustration as a user and a developer is the complete lack of clear information. Why do the event now if you don&#8217;t know shipping or price dates?</p>

<p>However the biggest, dumbest mistake that was made was deprecating legacy devices at the same time you announced a new product WITHOUT A CLEAR TIMELINE! Serious WTF panic inducing decision. Tell me, what the hell do I wth my launch Pre? Not complaining about deprecation, that I understand. How do I budget my time and money to buy your products, hmm?</p>

<p>What could be done better? You can&#8217;t improve what you haven&#8217;t done. Marketing gave a fancy sales pitch and that&#8217;s it. I have heard no actionable information.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an early adopter, I&#8217;m typing this out on my launch Pre. I understand deprecation, this is a 2 year old phone. But it&#8217;s time to tell marketing to can it and TALK to me. I&#8217;m not interested in your vague promises (like release dates, been burned once), I&#8217;m interested in honest &#8220;this is what&#8217;s up&#8221;. I have yet to hear it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lisa,</p>

<p>There are several things that should have been handled better last night.</p>

<p>1) When the afternoon announcement of devices happened, the devices went up on the Palm web site during the presentation.  It was there <em>then</em>.  When Matt said &#8220;Enyo development is available now.&#8221; It should have been available &#8220;now.&#8221;  Someone should have been sitting at the web site ready to press the button and drop the forum posts and the links.  That was a mistake.</p>

<p>2) The legacy hardware support needed to be in an official release, not an interview, not a twitter feed, not something.  Again, the forum post should have gone out -then-</p>

<p>3) The legacy hardware support should NOT LIE.  You know and I know that a Pre+ runs 2.1 just fine.  You know we&#8217;ve done it, you&#8217;ve seen them and we&#8217;ve laughed about it.  &#8220;The hardware isn&#8217;t good enough&#8221; needs a far more detailed explanation.  Transparency and truth matters here.</p>

<p>4) If a company needs to break a promise to its customers, they need to apologize and to say that there will be SOMETHING done about it.  Again, a formal announcement needed to be made.  This should have been PRIORITIZED so that the answers WERE found prior to Feb 9.  As it is, it sounded like the decision was made in some back room that morning.  Transparency is important.</p>

<p>5) The enyo presentation needed to address if enyo is being back-ported to 1.4.5.  That missing from the presentation and from any followup is huge.  The answer to it is critical.  Since we KNOW that enyo was originally developed on Pre-1&#8217;s we know what the answer SHOULD be&#8230;.  but whatever it is, we need to know</p>

<p>6) The availability of hybrid apps ever on 1.4.5 is critical.</p>

<p>7) Enyo on the desktop.  Matt talked about it, but we don&#8217;t have the vision.</p>

<p>8) Carriers, I know every one else said it too, but carriers NEEDED to be addressed yesterday.  Huge fail.</p>

<p>9) Two tiers of developers.  It&#8217;s really an issue that three-to-six-months before releasing the tablet, you have Amazon and Time as &#8220;tier one&#8221; developers who sign real nda&#8217;s and who get to find out about unreleased products and work on alpha level software so that they can do forward looking stuff, and then there are us &#8220;tier two&#8221; developers who can&#8217;t be trusted.  It would be really NICE if there was a way for developers who have proven their mettle to be promoted into tier one, sign paper nda&#8217;s and have access to nightly os builds and hardware specs for unreleased hardware even tho we&#8217;re NOT part of a giant company like Amazon.  I admit there has to be a means test, but shouldn&#8217;t those who HAVE DONE be those who CAN DO?</p>

<p>&#8212;- now, outside the numbered list &#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>The morning session made it clear that HP plans on creating an ecology of webOS running on a variety of devices which inherently and almost magically share data and information and which allow seamless access to your life.  It&#8217;s very cool and allows me to start to have a vision of how webOS could penetrate the minds of millions of consumers and create a very exciting</p>

<p>The idea that webOS will be embedded on the desktop of two laptops a second, plus a gazillion printers, and that people will want software to run in that environment and sync to their phones and tablets is very exciting&#8230;  but the question of profiles on multiple devices, and how developers will be paid etc are all open questions that I suspect HP hasn&#8217;t addressed yet.</p>

<p>ADMITTING that they haven&#8217;t been addressed, and again being transparent will help us with that.</p>

<p>(Note also that questions like hybrid apps on multiple devices and PDK apps on multiple devices when the devices have different underlying hardware like dual core tablets and phones and intel/amd laptops are questions that need to be addressed too.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Dear Lisa,</p>

<p>I´ll speak my mind as a user (who´s closely interacting with quite a few devs).
The hardware and software showcased yesterday is awesome and has an immediate I-want-that-stuff-effect…BUT</p>

<p>What I can´t really understand is your question about &#8220;how we could have done better…&#8221;! 
Any official statement beforehand would have been better than dropping the bomb without further notice.
In consequence both devs and users are trying to get answers for the questions mentioned above and many more, but the only thing they can do is speculate which leaves them in most cases frustrated and disappointed.
I mean, even right now we´re not discussing this at an &#8220;official place&#8221; but a place which has been chosen because funkatron had to vent feelings many of us share (Please don´t get me wrong on this funkatron). 
I´m not going to enumerate all the facts which are being summed up nicely in many blog posts as we speak. It just feels like history´s repeating and that feels bad.</p>

<p>And what does it mean exactly when you say &#8220;Our challenge is that answers to a lot of these questions are a variation of “we don’t know yet,”
Let me repeat the questions and if &#8220;we don’t know yet&#8221; is your answer please use my question for every single one of them in return: &#8220;Do you really want me to believe that HP has/had no plans about this?&#8221;</p>

<p>“No word on app catalog going global at the developer event?” 
“No word on allowing hybrid apps into the app catalog at the developer event?” (was answered via Twitter by @unwiredben)
“No word from the PR folks about the 2.0 OTA broken promise at the developer event?”
“No word on how the palm profile works on multiple devices and the effect of that on app sales at the developer event?” 
“No word on the fate of the mojo push messaging service at the developer event?”
“No word on whether HP is going to sell these new devices in other countries, or whether the release date hinges on US carrier acceptance?”</p>

<p>What is needed is what funkatron called being &#8220;aggressively transparent&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>official explanation (I´m not saying apology) asap </li>
<li>answers to the questions above asap</li>
<li>start selling the HW asap w/o sim- or netlock 
&#8230;tbc</li>
</ul>

<p>I´m doing quite a lot of translations (german) for some devs and I as far as I can tell many are not dev´ing for webOS because of money but because they love the OS and the community. 
But in the light of yesterdays news and Mr. Apothekers overstated promise they feel betrayed, lied to…use whichever superlative you want. If they are about to jump ship, what´s left for the users to do…</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Lisa - If the hardware wasn&#8217;t going to be available, at least for pre-order yesterday, it should have been a developers-only event to show off Enyo &amp; give the developers a look at the new devices with it clearly stated that you don&#8217;t have products ready to ship yet. I considered traveling across the country to attend the event when I got the invite; I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t today.</p>

<p>With all the build-up &amp; Leo publicly saying &#8220;the hardware is ready&#8221;, how can you possibly be surprised that folks are disappointed &amp; angry with being told it&#8217;ll be available in 3-7 months; especially when iPhone 4 is available TODAY and iPhone 5 &amp; iPad 2 are both probably going to be released before the new devices come out &#8220;in the summer&#8221;? I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ve gone to that new time-frame because noone can say &#8220;in the coming months&#8221; with a straight face anymore.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a Palm-faithful for many years &amp; think WebOS is great but as great as it is, there&#8217;s a huge imbalance between the number of IOS/Android vs WebOS apps and now I&#8217;m being punished for being an early adopter of the Pre- with no upgrade path to new hardware or WebOS 2.x. How does H&#92;Palm hope to convince devs that they should spend their time &amp; resources to develop WebOS apps when customers are being driven away from the platform?</p>

<p>Palm has a history of showing up a year late to the party with it&#8217;s phones. H&#92;Palm needs to take a hard look at the business unit &amp; decide whether they want to truly commit to being in the game before all their customers have shifted to other platforms because they don&#8217;t trust H&#92;Palm to have their backs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I let my contract with Sprint lapse thinking that whatever was announced yesterday would help me decided what to do next. Yesterday left me wanting to try the new phones and the TouchPad ASAP but upset that there wasn&#8217;t enough preparation done to get us legacy users ready for not being able to upgrade our software.</p>

<p>I held off buying a Pre- until Dec. 2009 and am currently on my third one (still upset about having to pay for the second one even though it was a known defect that caused it to not function properly).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be OK waiting until for a new phone until &#8220;later this year&#8221; if I was able to update to webOS 2.0. I&#8217;m loving the OS and I&#8217;m a huge HP fan but I wish there were clearer answers. I hope we get some good ones soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;How (you) could have handled this better?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t lie to or mislead the customers.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t let your fiercest advocates know via dueling blog interviews that the upgrades they have been promised aren&#8217;t&#8230;are&#8230;maybe&#8230;nope, not going to happen after all.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t have the CEO promise &#8220;no more announcing products not ready to ship&#8221; and then announce products with no set release date, no carriers, and no pricing.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t EVERPLEASENOWECAN&#8217;TBELIEVEITHAPPENEDAGAIN announce devices that are so far from being released it gives the competition time to steal your thunder.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t leave your developers in the dark.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t bill a marketing event as a developer event.  The devs know the difference, and will obviously be disappointed by the former when they are expecting the latter.</p>

<p>And for the love of all that is good, don&#8217;t go out on what is supposed to be a super-big-awesome-announcement day and get egg on your face by having this all come to a head in a way that makes the world&#8217;s biggest tech company look like some noob startup run by management school dropouts.</p>

<p>DO please encourage people responsible for this mess to read some blog and forum postings so they can get a feel for the amount of anger and disappointment this has created.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Holy snap, these are some awesome and thoughtful replies.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hearing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Presentations are good, but discussions are better.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  We had a LOT of Palm staff at the reception last night to make ourselves available for questions, but it would be even better to have an environment where everyone benefits from the questions asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the guts to come out and deliver bad news.</p>

<p>We knew that making an official 2.0 OTA announcement would ruin everyone&#8217;s day, so we were hoping to get some buffer time before telling everyone the bad news.  But when Precentral asked directly, it would have been dishonest to give a non-answer that would have kept everyone&#8217;s hopes up.  THERE WILL BE PROGRAMS TO GET PEOPLE INTO NEW DEVICES, we just don&#8217;t have the details worked out yet.  Worst.  Timing.  Ever.</p>

<p>Regarding arguments that the Pre+ hardware will run 2.x just fine&#8230;I don&#8217;t have all the details on why the call was made to not offer a tethered update solution to people who really want it.  But one could logically assume from statements made yesterday that it&#8217;s something we were seriously considering.</p></li>
<li><p>So what&#8217;s the development path?</p>

<p>If you have an existing Mojo app, continue to maintain it and optimize it for Pre3&#8217;s screensize (we&#8217;ll have details on how to do this).  Maybe do some minor feature enhancements, but start shifting your focus to develop a TouchPad version of your app.  Enyo will only be available on the TouchPad at first, but you&#8217;ll be able to leverage most of your work when Enyo comes to phones later this year.  Remember, this is exactly what Enyo was designed for.</p>

<p>The next few months are gonna be rough while we work through this Mojo / Enyo transition phase, but it’ll still be way easier than going down the path of forcing Mojo to support larger screen sizes.  After we get through it, the future market that we hope will be available to you will more than make up for temporarily duplicated efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>What carriers?  What dates?  WTF?</p>

<p>This is outside my area of expertise, but yeah&#8230;would be nice to know.  =]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>Hope this helps, guys.  Keep it coming.</p>

<p>me as a webOS developer, community member and evangelist was expecting more that &#8220;just&#8221; the Enyo Presentation at the Developer Event. Happening after the presentation of new products with many developers attending, i expected answers about the future of webOS from a developer perspective. Unanswered questions (see webosinternals&#8217; list above) that i assumed would be answered at such an occasion.</p>

<p>Maybe it was unreasonable to expect answers at that time? But i&#8217;ve heard and read &#8220;at least we&#8217;re trying&#8221;, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know yet&#8221;, &#8220;we can&#8217;t disclose yet&#8221;, &#8220;in the coming months&#8221; for a while now. The 2.0 SDK has been in Early Access for months now, the Pre 2 is running a pre-release webOS 2.0, international paid apps/hardware availability is unclear, international develope relations is unclear, the list goes on.</p>

<p>Please communicate clearly and openly about the future plans &#8230; why not at developer event with hunderts of developer attending, isn&#8217;t there a better occasion?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the ongoing discussiona and responses where you can, Lisa.  The one thing I don&#8217;t get is the hope for &#8220;buffer time&#8221;.  Pretty much anyone could have figured that the 2.0 update question would be asked, so not having something planned seems&#8230;odd.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So many comments have really laid out the problem. The most troubling thing is really summed up in Lisa&#8217;s post - &#8220;we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is the problem with communication at Palm? As someone on the Developer Relations team, I expect you to know about upcoming developer issues. But from your postings last night, it looks like your team was left out of the loop. I mean, you&#8217;re sitting here on Twitter saying there will be an upgrade while Engadget&#8217;s posting an interview with Ruby saying there isn&#8217;t. Do you see how badly it is that the Developer Relations (or should I say, Damage Control) team were the LAST people to know? It means the people above you knew they were throwing developers under the bus and didn&#8217;t want to hear about until the last possible second. I&#8217;m sure you realize what a terrible position this puts you in more than anyone, but I feel compelled to point this out.</p>

<p>But more importantly, why were the issues not considered during development? It&#8217;s like no one cared that you had a base, like you could just start over and everyone would forget the time and money they&#8217;ve invested in the app ecosystem. I look at the reasons people say updating to 2.0 would be difficult and I wonder: why didn&#8217;t Palm plan for this? Profile incompatibility?! Having to run apps in the emulator on a Touchpad because you dropped the gesture area? The return of back and forward? Pray tell, are devlopers now going to have to launch interfaces for both gesture area devices and those without them? Or are we now abandoning that completely? I mean just&#8230;so many things.</p>

<p>If I had to offer my suggestions, it would been to hold this event later or to not have wasted your time with the developer event in November, and instead have had one almost immediately following what transpired yesterday. It&#8217;s been months for us, we expected something more concrete.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame for this mark to be on the event as I definitely dug the new hardware, too. I want a Pre 3&#8230;not so much now with the developer issues. I&#8217;m not sure whether the support webOS needs will be there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The problem, Lisa, with variations of &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; is then it shouldn&#8217;t have been discussed in the first place.  This is the biggest point of frustration between Palm and anyone not-Palm.  Palm makes big announcements before they&#8217;re ready for prime-time.  Get your stuff together, THEN announce.</p>

<p>If a man asked you to marry him before he had the ring, would it be as special?  How do you suppose you might react if he said the ring would be coming &#8220;in the coming months&#8221; after his trip to spring break in Miami?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Very great article. I had nothing but high hopes for this Feb 9th. All i seem to have is a bitter taste in my mouth and the feeling of what could have been. HP really did drop the ball in many aspects. Is it that difficult to understand the urgency of making products make it out the door in a timely manner? Is it that difficult to understand WITHOUT DEVICES IN THE STORES THEY WILL NOT SELL. A press conference showing what is on the way &#8220;in the coming months&#8221; will/and did cause disgust and outrage in a community literally BEGGING for a flagship device in their hands yesterday&#8230; My two cents.</p>

<p>My issue is with a company lying. I know it is not your decision, but my advice is to keep honest. It&#8217;s one thing when other companies split hairs over multi-tasking and such. But whole features and whole major upgrades is a huge issue. Maybe if Palm promised something, HP acquired and changed the roadmap without agreeing to Palm&#8217;s promises, I could understand a major change. But HP made promises too.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On Sprint phones we was promised Adobe Flash. This was not a make-or-break deal for me, but they should follow through with the word. Do not lie.</p></li>
<li><p>Palm &amp; HP both have said they would upgrade the Pre&#8217;s for sure to at least 2.0. Now backing out is another contradiction. Do not lie.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if a path to a new phone is made, it will cost us much more than planned now. Even a free phone, unlikely, offered on Sprint now will cost $10 a month more adding to $120 a year plus taxes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Someone in the company should have back-bone and set the record straight. So many mixed reports. Have a meeting getting executives on &#8216;close to the same page&#8217; and report what your intentions are. People waiting around for months on in getting promises that are empty is never good in the long-run.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OK, I&#8217;m going to break my NDA, a secret promise, since Palm broke their highly-advertised promise.</p>

<p>I was on the webOS 2.1 beta on current devices, and things were coming along fine. There were a few bugs, as is normal for software development and they were being hammered out, but MY Pre plus was operating as a whole much more smoothly than it is now on 1.4.5. Suddenly and without warning, late last month the beta was pulled and we were told to doctor back to 1.4.5 and trash our old builds&#8212;never to speak of this again.</p>

<p>To lie to the public and say that it &#8220;cannot support webOS 2&#8221; is disingenuous at best and flat-out lying at its worst.</p>

<p>I bought my phone at Verizon&#8217;s webOS launch date about a year ago. Now my phone is obsolete and i&#8217;m locked into a contract where I can&#8217;t upgrade without serious financial consequence until the fall? Are you telling me that I won&#8217;t even be able to buy the NEW HARDWARE as it comes out without paying some ungodly $500-$600 MSRP? Not even Apple throws legacy users under the bus like that.</p>

<p>Lisa, unless Palm speaks and SPEAKS NOW, it&#8217;s over and done for me. This Pre plus will magically wind up in a cup and I&#8217;ll walk back to BlackBerry with an insurance replacement. At least RIM still supports THEIR &#8220;legacy&#8221; devices for a few years.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I understand now why there is so much frustration regarding the issue why the old hardware is not getting WebOS 2.0  The problem is that the new hardware is not yet available and will not be available for months.  Therefore, frustration arises from developers who were thinking about developing for WebOS 2.0 thinking that all the current user base would get the 2.0 update.  If the Pre 3 was available within a few weeks (Just like we thought we heard from the HP CEO) then things would be taken as a transition.  However, as of today all we have is a 4 to 6 months gap.  I can wait, but some developers want to get the ball rolling now on WebOS 2.0 devices.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Lisa:
I appreciate the transparency. It&#8217;s a real start. But we need information on an upgrade program NOW. Not in the coming months but now. I&#8217;m sorry but you guys just f*cked up in a big way and you owe it to your customer base to tell them what is going on with your upgrade program. Many of them will jump ship after having lost faith in HP, expecting the upgrade policy to be minor or nonexistent. If it doesn&#8217;t compensate users in a huge way, you will lose a huge percentage of the userbase. Many pre- owners have already gone out and bought EVOs.
As has been stated earlier. 2.0 came out in november. There is absolutely no reason why a phone should not be able to run an OS announced 8 months after its release.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a developer, I would appreciate a simple way to transition my apps into Enyo.</p>

<p>Do all 5,000+ apps in the App Cat really need to be re-coded? Wow.</p>

<p>As far as the &#8220;No OTA&#8221; news goes, that really should have been an official announcement.
I can understand not wanting it to be part of the big event.
But it should have been announced by Palm (blog.palm.com??) and not on P|C.
I really don&#8217;t think P|C handled that as well as they could have.
Neither did WOR.</p>

<p>I can understand the hardware not being up to the challenge. Trust me, I know that it&#8217;s asking a lot.
But we really were looking forward to it.
I hope that Doctors are available to the Pre users that want to go forward.</p>

<p>And like was already mentioned; prices, exact dates, and carriers should have been announced.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>HP&#8217;s problem is a problem of <a href="http://www.ericmackonline.com/ICA/blogs/emonline.nsf/dx/ethics-are-the-foundation-of-effective-knowledge-management">ethics in business</a>. My friend Eric Mack states the problem as as it pertains to Knowledge Management:</p>

<p>&gt; Here&#8217;s how I currently define the argument for Ethics in KM</p>

<p>&gt; 1. Knowledge Management is about sharing of knowledge, information, and experiences - an exchange of information and ideas . (We often call this learning.)</p>

<p>&gt; 2. This exchange cannot occur without effective communication.</p>

<p>&gt; 3. For communication to be truly effective, transparency must exist. Transparent communication is built on trust.</p>

<p>&gt; 4. Any unethical behavior undermines trust which ultimately impairs communication which leads to the loss of sharing and the loss (or distortion) of information and knowledge.</p>

<p>&gt; The bottom line is that ethics is important to KM because of trust.</p>

<p>I believe this old adage applies, &#8220;it takes 20 good deeds to make up for one bad deed.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Lisa, The only thing Palm could do now to make things right is start acting QUICKLY and decisively. We&#8217;ve all had to wait for &#8220;the coming months,&#8221; to get 2.x on Pre/Pixi, and now we have to wait for &#8220;the coming weeks,&#8221; to find out if there&#8217;s a chance we will or won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Adding to the confusion, there&#8217;s the new www.palm.com/webos-info page which is giving users on differing carriers differing messages about if their phone may or may not get the update. Stop being cryptic, just come out and tell us and don&#8217;t have us waiting for an endlessly undefined period of time.</p>

<p>All I&#8217;d be happy with would be Palm to come out and say (within a week or two) if Pres and Pixis would get the update to 2.x at all, and a release date for the tethered solution. If not, then a statement outlining plans (voucher scheme?), which carriers and what terms.</p>

<p>Personally, if voucher scheme was the way to go, the only thing I&#8217;d be happy with would be a complimentary, new, unlocked Pre 2 direct from HP. I don&#8217;t want to be locked into another contract with a Palm device, nor do I want to pay for one again, or at least for the forseeable future. That&#8217;s some serious badwill that Palm has generated right there. I wouldn&#8217;t be happy with just discounts, as I have no interest in paying to upgrade a device I shouldn&#8217;t have to spend ANY money on in the first place. Only if that happened might I consider staying with webOS. In fact, I&#8217;d prefer if Palm would just buy me out my contract so I could go get a phone running another OS, I&#8217;m that angry.</p>

<p>Note that I DO understand the reasons for not providing the OTA update and not maintaining backward compatibility, and some of the points made are very valid. However, when your early adopters are still right in the middle of their 2 or 3 year contracts, this is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Apologies for length, but I, like most others, am very angry and feel betrayed and mistreated by Palm. In short, Palm NEEDS to take rapid, decisive action NOW to do right by their existing fanbase.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;d be wise for Palm to remember that the people who are angry now have driven sales of Pres and Pixis considerably (3 people I know have bought Pres as I&#8217;ve advocated them in the past - how stupid I feel now!) in the past. If they want these passionate users to continue to do the same, Palm would be wise to keep them happy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Directed at people in general:</p>

<p>To what extent is it possible that these issues, albeit large and needing to be resolved, are still due to the transition of a small company into one the size of HP? From what I&#8217;ve gathered, HP seems to be run in a tree structure, with each &#8220;department&#8221; (or whatever you want to call it, group, etc.) being fairly autonomous. I would guess (just a college undergrad here) that small companies are used to autonomy, but can deal with it, given their size.</p>

<p>When a small company that&#8217;s used to a specific way of doing things gets integrated into the monstrosity that is HP, there HAS to be structural/hierarchical issues that cause break-downs in communication, if only because the giant company has a structure setup.</p>

<p>I do agree, these are problems, but many of them seem to be communications issues, and not entirely lack of preparation.</p>

<p>In short, is it possible we&#8217;re being too hard on a HUGE company that hasn&#8217;t quite figured out how to be as dynamic and responsive as smaller companies (which don&#8217;t have the organizational overhead in place already) can be?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Lisa,</p>

<p>While I can only really speak as a user I&#8217;d like to chime in with another reason as to why the lack of 2.0 support for the older devices stings. Contract length. I can&#8217;t speak for the US but here in the UK the majority of contracts are 18-24 months. With the release of the Pre Plus approximately a year ago this means that anybody who took out a new contract with a Pre Plus has at a minimum ~6 months left before they can upgrade. While the tech industry moves fast it shouldn&#8217;t be unreasonable to expect support for a product to last the duration of a typical contract as I expect many, if not most users cannot justify upgrading in the middle of a contract.</p>

<p>Second, thank you to Lisa, Chuq, and the others, for being stand-up people and taking the lumps that really should be felt much further up the org chart.</p>

<li>Pixi2, um, Pre Nano, um, Veer has access to webOS 2.2, but no gyro or replaceable battery (or 4G), and no availability until &#8220;summer&#8221;</li>
<li>PalmPad, um, TouchPad has webOS 3.x, gyro, and Enyo, but NO GESTURE AREA (WTF does management think the customers like about webOS?), and no availability until &#8220;summer&#8221;</li>

Sprint basically isn&#8217;t getting any hardware, and my Pre- is about shot. I don&#8217;t mind not getting 2.0, that&#8217;s fine because it&#8217;s not that big of a deal. MY problem is that Sprint&#8217;s not getting any new hardware, and if it was announced that we were, Sprint&#8217;s doing some new BS where if you don&#8217;t upgrade your current before April 1st, then your upgrade is reset for like 11 months or something.</p>

<p>Keeping my opinions on the business side of this equation where I am most qualified, it appears to me that what happened here is that all of these questions have been asked many times on twitter and on the various blogs for months.  If hp/palm had paid attention and answered the questions openly and honestly before yesterday, this wouldn&#8217;t have turned out so badly.  It doesn&#8217;t really matter how they would have handled it ay that time.</p>

<p>And someone seems to have some indecision problems.  If they knew two months ago that upgrading the older phones would be a problem, then 2 months is way too long in this market to make a decision on how to handle it. If I&#8217;m Leo, today I&#8217;m figuring out who that person is and&#8230;requesting an in person meeting&#8230;not good.</p>

<p>This must be a joke, a really bad joke :(</p>

<p>HP/Palm asking here what they should have done?</p>

<p>The answer to me is clear: such a big company should have the answers before. All the big numbers in the event and we end here?</p>

<p>This is not serious. As developers, we have to
look for info from 3rd parties? And you start such a serious debate outside your own place?</p>

<p>You NEED developers, you make money from their apps (directly and indirelecty), and you need to take care of the small developers. They are the evangelists of WebOS, they do for fun, love, and they are LOYAL.</p>

<p>How many time do you think this loyalty will remain?. No clear answers, no clear timelines&#8230;nothing is clear and even worse, now you start to lie to the people who where with you from day one (oh, great, you have partnership with Time inc, where were them on 2009?)</p>

<p>As a user, I bought my pre- as soon as could get it. Had to change company, pay more for the contract. And you want to convince us that te pre- is obsolete? we all have seen what the pre- is capable of, thanks to the HB community. The pre- can compete with most of the phones with some HB goodies.</p>

<p>What should you do? first, apologize.</p>

<p>Do your homework NOW. When was the info on the developer site last updated?, when was the last time you gave clear info to developers?&#8230; etc. Enoguh waiting, &#8220;soon&#8221;, &#8220;in the comming months&#8221; is insulting your people.</p>

<p>Do an exchange program. Give every user of all these devices who are now &#8220;obsolete&#8221; a new device for FREE and donate the previous devices to non-proffit organizations.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t even try to make an exchange program where people have to pay anything, don&#8217;t make money from the mess you just created.</p>

<p>I thought someone said this company wanted to look &#8220;cool&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>Lose money now to recover your loyal coustomers and developers before they go somewhere else. Lose money now to recover the love the webos community had. This will make you clearly different from the competition in the near future, before people go somewhere else&#8230;</p>

<p>And please, remember, THERE IS A WHOLE WORLD OUTSIDE THE STATES&#8230;</p>

<p>Do a very simple experiment: at MWC2011 in Barcelona, ask randomly to people what a pre or a pixi is&#8230;.</p>

<p>This is are my opinions/sugestions, sorry for the long post, but as I said before all this is becoming a very, very bad joke and kind of a nightmare.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I posted on zhephree&#8217;s blog and I will here too, and will try not to repeat myself. In short I have one app out I just got out on Feb. 2nd in the catalog. Didn&#8217;t know an javascript and still know little. Took me months to make a pretty simple app, in part because of available time and having to learn. I still have a lot to learn no matter if it&#8217;s Mojo or Enyo. App #2 for me is a mystery as to how to proceed, but the more I talk about this the more I am convinced it will be done in Enyo simply because I would probably end up finishing around summer anyways. We&#8217;ll see, one of my question has something to do with this decision&#8230;.</p>

<p>I love the questions raised above. Another question I have is this: The Pre 3 and Veer will be released with webOS 2.2 correct? Ok, the phone app is done in Enyo, but how much Enyo can they handle? Do I have to worry about making a Mojo app for if I want it on the Pre 3/Veer?</p>

<p>Last night was a disappointment, LAST NIGHT. I feel for a developer conference that had people travel from all over for it was too short, it was an expansion of the info given in November and that&#8217;s it. I was sitting at home following a live blog and felt that. Needed a solid group Q&amp;A session. Also, the question above originally posted last night by webOS Internals should have been addressed. You want to attract new developers? They need to know those answers just as much as current ones to figure out it webOS is good for them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am a new developer. In-fact I am only a developer because I bought into the idea that palm webOS was such an easy platform to develop on, and so I started reading on html and JS, and before I knew it, I had 2 apps in the AppCat.</p>

<p>So my frustration is this, I barely know mojo, and now I have to learn Enyo; learning Enyo is not a bad thing since its much better going into the future: however Enyo does not support and other device at the moment, therefore, I have to maintain mojo and pick up Enyo.</p>

<p>It seems odd that Enyo is not yet ready to support all devices, this will no doubt cause many devs to hold off on development for the time being (for a company with 6k apps, this is not good).</p>

<p>Lisa, I thank you for even being here to answers some of these questions, and please don&#8217;t get frustrated with us, the main reason that there is such a backlash from devs in such a way is because we all love this platform so much and had such high hopes, many of us feel betrayed and disappoint.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lots of other points coming up around why we even held the event before having all the answers (emphasis on ALL, which I&#8217;ll come back to in a minute).  That&#8217;s a damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t position &#8212; either don&#8217;t do it soon enough to make changes, or do it too soon and start with chaos.  It&#8217;s really tough to balance this just right.</p>

<p>One thing we should have done was set better expectations that the event was more of a &#8220;marketing&#8221; presentation instead of a technical deep dive.  Our intent was to give as many devs as we could a chance to celebrate with us and see what we&#8217;ve been working on, but you guys are clearly too hardcore to party before business is taken care of.  Noted.  =]</p>

<p>To clarify what I meant by &#8220;variation of we don’t know yet,&#8221; I mean that more in a &#8220;we don&#8217;t have all the details worked out yet&#8221; way rather than &#8220;we have no freaking idea&#8221; way.  We definitely know enough to help you guys start preparing for the next generation of webOS development, we just don&#8217;t have it written up in a pretty package right now.</p>

<p>Operators aren&#8217;t exactly standing by since a bunch of key folks are currently on a plane to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress, but perhaps we should take the specific what&#8217;s and how&#8217;s of how this transition will work to the webOS developer forum where we already have a process for getting them answered.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all your wonderful feedback, and know that the entire developer relations staff is taking it very seriously.  This will all be worth it in the end, and that&#8217;s a promise we won&#8217;t break.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to hear that Dev Relations is taking this seriously, but if the rest of your company doesn&#8217;t take it seriously, then that you do so will be irrelevant despite your best intentions.  We know that you and many others are <em>trying</em> to do the right thing.  We just no longer have any faith that it is possible.  HP and Palm appear to have too much momentum in the wrong direction to turn around at this point, again, despite the best intentions of many.</p>

<p>I hope I am wrong about this, because I WANT HP (Palm) to turn around, to succeed, to gain market share.  I just no longer see how it is possible after so many profound and recent missteps.</p>

<p>HP and Palm were so very far off from where they should have been, two days ago, that I still find it stunning.  And it sounds like communication within Palm and HP absolutely failed.  Heck, the Palm web page still says that 2.0 is coming to the legacy devices.  Check out the URL:</p>

<p>http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre-family.html</p>

<p>where it says, right now, that 2.0 is arriving in the &#8220;coming months&#8221; for all devices listed on that page.  How is it possible for one company to deliver such a fragmented and inconsistent message?</p>

<p>I have a couple apps in the catalog&#8230; And think the time required to transition them will be worth it. It&#8217;s just javascript. Many people are overlooking the fact that Enyo will help people launch their apps onto other platforms (Android, iPhone etc&#8230;).</p>

<p>I think we should all be happy that HP hasn&#8217;t pulled a Nokia.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="http://al3x.net/2011/01/15/user-hostile-platforms.html">Alex&#8217;s original post</a>, if you haven&#8217;t. What follows are some thoughts in response to his post.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>These are all native OS X apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dress-assistant/id412648913?mt=12">Dress Assistant</a></li>
<li><a href="http://easeintotheswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mac-os-x-leopard-time-machine2-1024x640.png">Time Machine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://images.ientrymail.com/webpronews/article_pics/twitter-for-mac.jpg">Twitter for Mac</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also think they all fly in the face of UX consistency within a system GUI, which I think is one of the things people bitch about with non-native apps.</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of &#8220;native&#8221; is really fuzzy here. it seems like you mean &#8220;uses the GUI toolkit that ships with the OS.&#8221; By this definition, though, I&#8217;d argue that many popular OS X apps are not &#8220;native,&#8221; even though they&#8217;re Cocoa apps. On Linux, Gnome and KDE apps are both &#8220;native,&#8221; but they certainly don&#8217;t look the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of your examples of people wanting native apps are people simply liking an app better because it&#8217;s designed better, and provides a consistent aesthetic with the rest of their desktop. That can and is often accomplished independent of the SDK you use. &#8220;Native&#8221; is not in any way synonymous with &#8220;better,&#8221; but lots of people toss it out there as if the argument is so obvious, it needs not be explained. It&#8217;s a lot like saying &#8220;it scales.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Cross platform and &#8220;native&#8221; aren&#8217;t necessarily mutually exclusive. It&#8217;s harder, yes, but not impossible. there are tons of variables involved, and I think you&#8217;re oversimplifying a pretty complex problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross platform is not, by definition, user-hostile. It <em>can</em> be harder to file off the rough edges, depending on the dev platform and the application, but I think that&#8217;s a matter of UX effort.</p></li>
<li><p>IME, &#8220;Native&#8221; UIs matter way less to users on mobile. Like, unless it looks like a fucking turd and totally nonfunctional, most users don&#8217;t care. Is it relatively smooth to navigate? Bonus. Spaz webOS is, from what I can tell, probably the most popular Twitter client on webOS. Why? Because it&#8217;s free. You know how many of my users have praised it for using &#8220;native&#8221; widgets, for the most part? Like 4, and they are all ultranerds.</p></li>
<li><p>Many (most?) of the AIR apps I&#8217;ve seen really should just be web apps, because there&#8217;s no great benefit to them being desktop apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Why are we okay with using some web apps if it&#8217;s such a huge issue? I prefer to use Gmail&#8217;s web interface, for example, and I prefer to use Google Reader in a SSB &#8212; although with a custom theme. Is it just that my expectations are different?</p></li>
<li><p>I think for many teams, like the one you mention, the choices are probably these (pick one):</p>

<ol>
<li>a really strong web app (that might not support some browsers)</li>
<li>a cross-platform app based on web tech (devs can use existing skills)</li>
<li>a native app for a single platform &#8212; probably not OS X.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which do you choose? I guarantee you that for a company like Pandora, it does not make financial sense to do native Windows and OS X clients. Folks who 1. care and 2. would pay are grey-bearded unicorns in the grand scheme of things.</p></li>
<li><p>So why don&#8217;t devs want to do native apps? I&#8217;d argue it&#8217;s because <em>it&#8217;s too hard</em>, especially when you need to support multiple platforms with widely varying capabilities. If you want better integration with the rest of the devices, make it easier for the people driving new app dev to do so. Asking them to jump from JavaScript to ObjC is not something most will swallow, and the trend is not going to reverse back to devs doing lower-level coding. Some types of applications will always require it, but many (most!) won&#8217;t. A high-level language like JavaScript (especially with the work that&#8217;s been done to speed it up) with hooks into a fast GUI toolkit (not the DOM) is, I believe, where we should be headed.</p></li>
</ul>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you’re right that ‘native’ is a slightly over-rated term, but there’s definitely something in Alex’s post.</p>

<p>Huawei could definitely have done better than the appalling client they rebadged for telcos, considering the millions of units sold. (At the most trivial level, the version I have was shipped with log4j debug settings left on, let alone the higher level problems). I don’t think Java was to blame, so much as a symptom - of aiming low - and achieving your goal.</p>

<p>The other problem is when developers clearly just don’t get that there are standard keyboard shortcuts people expect to use. I can’t recall what it is, but there is one program I have that doesn’t offer a keyboard shortcut for quit. That’s ‘user-hostile’ in my book, but I don’t think it’s intentional, so much as born out of ignorance. And that’s as true for Windows native applications as anything else – in the 2 decades I’ve been doing commercial development, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a company give any formal training in those aspects of development, or into a test plan.</p>

<p>You are probably right that on mobile this may not be an issue - but I think that’s largely because there isn’t yet a consistent vocabulary that users are used to.</p>

<p>(Although I can think of one example - someone developing x-platform native clients for iOS and Android, but who only understands iOS, may miss the possibilities of the application-as-a-service architecture in Android, being used to application-as-a-silo).</p>

<p>It’s certainly an issue with web apps – I completely surprised a colleague of mine by dragging-and-dropping within a Flex application, because he didn’t know you could do it, and he’d ‘trained’ himself not to drag’n’drop inside the browser window. People don’t expect keyboard shortcuts in web apps either, especially where the logical key has a browser level meaning. How should CTRL-A work?</p>

<p>Of course that is irrelevant to the 95% of users who never use any shortcuts at all &#8230; but it feels like a step backwards at times.</p>

<p>A good x-platform GUI toolkit won&#8217;t give you any of that -
it&#8217;s about understanding the platforms you are working with, and expectations of users. Which I OK, because most of them have low expectations!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Finally got around to reading both of these posts. Or at least Alex&#8217;s edited post. Parts of his post speaks to the UX snob in me, and this post mostly to the pragmatist, both from a dev and a user perspective. I think overall performance and those consistent keyboard shortcuts are super-important, way moreso than consistent-looking widgets. But that&#8217;s just me.</p>

<p>I do think AIR in particular has its annoyances, particularly the two-step install and confusingly separate runtime. Most users won&#8217;t understand or care about this space/bandwidth-saving maneuver at all, they just know it&#8217;s odd. Likewise, the need to sign apps with expensive certs or face warning dialogs presented to your users is a real shame, particularly when OSS could (did?) have so much to do with the uptake of AIR in the first place.</p>

<p>Titanium is a step in the right direction, with the ability to package the runtime with the app, greater entrenchment in terms of system access, and on mobile, those native widgets (dubious though their importance may be).</p>

<p>So long as developers can present the important bits of an application in such a way as to please their most important/abundant consumers, everything else - consistent UI, toolchains and languages all - is absolutely unimportant.</p>

<div class="photo-credit"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carnero/4728435040/">Photo by carnero</a></div>

<p>A friend of mine asked me today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have my own idea for a mobile and desktop app.</p>
  
  <p>Would you have any recommendation on what SDKs to use? I&#8217;d like to use as few as possible and get cross platform as possible. The app is simple, it basically connects to a web service, gets data, and makes charts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get this kind of question a lot, so I thought I&#8217;d share what I wrote to him:</p>

<p>There are a couple options for app frameworks, and on one framework there are a bunch of options for UI/DOM frameworks.</p>

<p>First off, the cross-platform mobile frameworks I know about are JavaScript-based. I know at least one which is game-oriented and uses Lua, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;re doing game dev.  So, you&#8217;ll need to be doing your work in JS at least, and possibly JS/HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>There are really two solid options I see for locally-installed apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/">Appcelerator Titanium Mobile</a>: focuses on native-looking apps; essentially a JavaScript bridge to the native platform on iOS and Android. They&#8217;re close to having Blackberry available too. This works well if you really need to use truly native UI widgets and only need those top 2-3 platforms, and/or need deeper integration into native APIs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>: Basically a packager that takes a webkit browser app and encapsulates it into a package to install locally on your device. Has <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/about">much wider support for different platforms</a>, but only hooks into the most common native APIs. Also doesn&#8217;t provide any kind of UI toolkit &#8212; it&#8217;s all Webkit, so you make your own choices for a DOM framework. Mobile web frameworks to look at include <a href="http://joapp.com/">Jo</a>, <a href="http://xuijs.com/">xui</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a>, <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a>, and others.  Or, you just build it yourself with custom HTML/CSS/JS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<div class="photo-credit"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mbiebusch/4733437831/">Photo by mbiebusch</a></div>

<p>Our move to using oAuth for authentication in Spaz is going well. Many people have stepped up to help get the <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore">SpazCore</a> libraries working, and <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-desktop-air">Spaz Desktop</a> has been updated to use the new authentication methods, both in the 0.8 branch and master.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">Spaz webOS</a> still hasn&#8217;t had work done on it to get oAuth working. July 16th is the Twitter Basic Auth cutoff, so we don&#8217;t have much time.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the big news: <strong>Palm has donated Palm Pre Plus phones for AT&amp;T for me to GIVE AWAY to the top 3 contributors to Spaz webOS from now until July 12</strong>. That&#8217;s the day (I believe) we <em>need</em> to submit Spaz webOS to Palm for review, so it can be ready by the 16th.</p>

<p>So, you want a free phone? Get your ass in gear. Download the SDK now: 
<a href="http://bit.ly/duAHNg">http://bit.ly/duAHNg</a></p>

<p>To get through Palm&#8217;s review process, I believe we need to submit by July 12th. So before then, two things need to happen in Spaz webOS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter accounts need to use oAuth to authenticate, using xAuth to exchange username/password for auth keys initially </li>
<li>Image uploaders need to use oAuth Echo to post </li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;ve already accomplished this in the Spaz Desktop 0.8 branch, so doing it in webOS is very doable. Whether it gets done in time is up to you. I am <a href="http://twitter.com/funkatron">on Twitter</a>, available via email, and in #spaz on irc.freenode.net regularly to answer any questions.</p>

<p>Palm has been a major supporter of open source, and Spaz is (AFAICT)  the only open source microblogging client available on the platform. Help me keep it going, please.</p>

<p>Spaz has been around a long time: since early 2007, which I think makes it 77 in Internet Years.  It&#8217;s been a while since I started playing with the Twitter API in RealBasic, and later under AIR after I saw the Pownce desktop client and wanted to make my app look cool like it.</p>

<p>A lot has happened since then. A lot of cool stuff with Spaz, and lot of cool stuff for me, and a lot of sometimes cool and sometimes not so cool stuff with Twitter. Now we have a desktop client, still on AIR, and a native mobile client for webOS. Spaz isn&#8217;t SUPAR POPULAR, and it&#8217;s not proved to be anything but a giant time and money sinkhole, but it&#8217;s been a very fun ride.</p>

<p>Through all of this, Spaz has stuck with open technologies: JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We&#8217;ve done so because we&#8217;re dedicated to true openness and transparency. The Spaz Statement of Purpose spells out the project&#8217;s reason for being. And in the light of Twitter&#8217;s moves to make the microblogging client scene more of a closed monoculture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the significance of Spaz as a counter to closed technologies is greater than ever.</p>

<p>After some recent events &#8211; a big career move for me, some horseshit policy changes by Apple, and some disappointing moves by Twitter &#8211;&#160;I decided we needed to assess where Spaz is headed. So, like any good open source project guy, I went to IRC: I called a meeting on Freenode in #spaz. Turnout was encouraging, and we made some important decisions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen:</p>

<h3>Most urgent: implementation of OAuth/xAuth by June 1</h3>

<p>In June, Twitter is shutting off HTTP Basic Auth support. For client apps to function, they <em>must</em> start using OAuth or xAuth. Spaz Desktop has been approved to use xAuth, an OAuth variant where the user enters their username and password, and the server exchanges these for an OAuth access token. This means we can support a more typical user experience, but don&#8217;t have to store credentials anywhere &#8212; we just store the access token.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I added support in the SpazCore Twitter library to authenticate with an OAuth access token instead of Basic Auth. This should allow apps using SpazCore to use either Basic Auth (for systems that still support it, like StatusNet) or OAuth/xAuth. Much more needs to be done, though, to get Spaz Desktop and Mobile ready.</p>

<h3>Short term: get Spaz Desktop 0.10 out the door in June</h3>

<p>The Spaz 0.9 branch, which is the development branch for 0.10, has been stuck in dev for far too long. The codebase has been refactored considerably, and a number of cool features either have been implemented or are planned, but it needs to actually get ready and usable. We need a push, and assistance from a number of motivated folks who are willing to put the time in. Our <a href="https://spaz.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32566-spaz/milestones/current">0.10 milestone entry on spaz.lighthouseapp.com</a> outlines the various tasks that need to be completed.</p>

<h3>Longer term:</h3>

<h4>1. Move Spaz Desktop from AIR to Titanium Desktop by October 2010</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Appcelerator&#8217;s Titanium for a long time, and their Desktop product offers a compelling alternative to AIR for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Titanium is a true open platform: open source with a liberal license</li>
<li>JavaScript is fully a first-class citizen in terms of language support<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Titanium allows leveraging Ruby, Python or PHP</li>
<li>Better Linux support</li>
<li>Web Worker support</li>
<li>Full interaction with external processes</li>
<li>Native installers for each supported platform that includes the runtime</li>
</ul>

<p>The big knock I see against Titanium is poor documentation, and that&#8217;s something I really hope Appcelerator works to rectify.</p>

<p>All in all, though, Titanium is a better fit for us, technology and philosophy-wise. Porting to Titanium is probably about 20 hours of work as it stands now.</p>

<h4>2. Start development of web-based mobile/tablet client</h4>

<p>I really like powerful mobile devices, and I really like multitouch tablet devices like the iPad. What I don&#8217;t like are the restrictions being placed on developers by companies that refuse to be transparent about their policies. I think the way around that is to make a great mobile/multitouch web app.</p>

<p>A web app will also make Spaz available to all devices with mobile webkit browsers. It would run on Android, Palm webOS, and likely BlackBerry and Nokia devices (I&#8217;m not super familiar with those, but I believe they have webkit browsers now or will soon).</p>

<p>While Spaz will be a hosted web application, it will still be FOSS, and anyone would be able to get the source and set up their own install. In this sense, it would be an interesting complement to StatusNet.</p>

<p>If folks are motivated to create native clients for their preferred devices, that&#8217;s definitely a possibility &#8212; either with a wrapper system like PhoneGap, or a native UI system like Titanium Mobile. It just would not be, at least initially, a primary goal.</p>

<p>What about webOS? Not sure right now. It requires dedicated folks who will keep up with it. Nick Carter has helped a lot, but we need more help, and/or we need to leverage the stuff we do in the web-based mobile client. That may necessitate moving away from Mojo as a framework, though. Palm&#8217;s dev relations team has indicated that they are interested in making web apps first class on their system, though, and I suspect they&#8217;ll have some interesting stuff to make that possible.</p>

<h4>3. Target StatusNet as a top-tier service</h4>

<p>StatusNet has always been a favorite service of mine. They match our principles, and I think Spaz as a FOSS client and StatusNet as a FOSS service complement each other well. StatusNet needs better clients, and I think Spaz is decently positioned to be a part of that. So, I think we should create a StatusNet API library to support any StatusNet-specific features available, and implement support for this in Spaz.</p>

<p>We should also consider other services, like Facebook and RSS feeds. The first step would be developing SpazCore libraries for these.</p>

<h3>How to help</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping with Spaz, here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read our <a href="http://help.getspaz.com/faqs/general-25/statement-of-purpose">Statement of Purpose</a> and <a href="http://help.getspaz.com/faqs/general-25/diversity">Diversity Statement</a></li>
<li>Read <a href="http://help.getspaz.com/faqs/general-25/contribute">&#8220;How Can I Participate in the Spaz Project?&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Talk to us about what you&#8217;re interested in doing</li>
<li>Make a commitment to putting in a certain amount of time every week. Even a half-hour a week helping with user support is a <em>big</em> help.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a programmer. We will work with you to learn new skills. All you have to be is interested in building something cool with us.</p>

<p>Reducing choice is one of the reasons (maybe the primary reason) for Twitter&#8217;s purchase and repackaging of Tweetie as The Official iPhone Client. As Tweetie&#8217;s source is unlikely to be released, it does seem that we&#8217;re reducing choice and becoming less open/more closed. That isn&#8217;t necessarily their goal, but it&#8217;s a consequence.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<div class="photo-credit"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/magisterludi/405224443/">Photo by Miscpix</a></div>

<p>This is going to make two blog posts in a row that are &#8220;off the cuff&#8221; for me. This one particularly so, because it involves a lot of emotion, and not a lot of certainty. There are some arguments to be made, but most of it is about how I feel. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s hard to justify logically; it just is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been frustrated with Twitter regarding how it relates to its developer community for several months now. My perspective might be different from some folks, I think, because I&#8217;ve been a part of that community for a long time. The Twitter Dev Talk Google Group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/members?start=0&amp;sort=type">shows me</a> as joining on March 15, 2007. I remember being proud that I was asked to be a moderator for the group; it felt good to be both friends with some folks at Twitter, and a &#8220;Friend of Twitter&#8221; as someone from the company referred to me and a few others once.</p>

<p>It felt good because Twitter really seemed to make an effort to be open and transparent with their development community. We were part of what helped them get off the ground &#8212; not the biggest part by any means, but a part. At the time, the vibe I got from Twitter was that they were a group of people trying to build Cool Stuff. I liked that because I like building Cool Stuff too, for the sake of building it. It felt like it was being built by guys who had the same passion for making things that I do. I would hear that they really liked what I was doing in creating an open source, multi-platform client for Twitter; that it was important to have options like that.</p>

<p>Over the years I often found myself defending Twitter&#8217;s API team when folks would air their own frustrations. Some of those frustrations were valid, and some of them were based on really unrealistic expectations. I often said that it was foolish to build a business on top of Twitter, because (except in very rare circumstances) there was no guarantee of any service level of API feature permanence. Things were often pretty spotty back then in terms of uptime and performance; that frustrated a lot of people. But I had their back, ya know? I was a Friend.</p>

<p>Things grew, and things changed. That&#8217;s not really surprising at all. I&#8217;m happily naive of most things related to VC investment, but I suppose to keep up with all the traffic Twitter got as it became more popular, they needed money to pay for services and hire people. If you aren&#8217;t making any money, you need to ask people to give it to you. And now you have to worry about what they want, too.</p>

<p>In the past year or so, it felt like I was seeing a shift in how Twitter related to its developers. People move around in a big company, and that was surely part of it &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know all the New Dudes. And I had really withdrawn from the dev mailing list, because I was tired of dealing with spam and talking about uptime and downtime and social graphs and pagination limits.</p>

<p>But it got weirder when they announced <a href="chirp.twitter.com/">Chirp</a>, their &#8220;official developer conference.&#8221; Doing this event made sense, but I felt like some of their choices about who was speaking didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t see guys like <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorlinguist">Cameron Kaiser</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/abraham">Abraham Williams</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/marco">Marco Kaiser</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jazzychad">JazzyChad</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/dacort">Damon Cortesi</a> listed as speakers. Instead, I saw execs, pundits, and VC investors.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve been to a lot of developer conferences, both as an attendee and a speaker. And I&#8217;ve never seen a speaker lineup so devoid of actual developers. Anyone who knows me, knows that I generally believe pundits and VC investors (and execs to some extent) to be moronic at best, and pure evil at worst &#8212; corrupting the purity and passion for Making Cool Stuff.</p>

<p>Then there was how some stuff was handled. When Chirp was first announced in late January, before the speaker lineup was finalized, I inquired about speaking there myself. A friend suggested I talk about my experiences as an open source dev, and this seemed like a pretty darn good idea &#8211;&#160;I wanted to talk about <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/293">what I&#8217;d learned, what motivates us as developers, and how we define success</a>. So I made an official inquiry, and was told by a Twitter employee that they&#8217;d look into it and get back to me soon. I didn&#8217;t hear anything for a couple weeks, so I sent a follow-up, and was told that things were filling up on the main day (well, that&#8217;s why I asked early!) but that there might be an unconference opportunity. There&#8217;d be a public announcement about it in March.</p>

<p>Well, the conference is on April 15th. Not knowing until March what might happen is just not enough time to plan. And to buy a $450 ticket, and then hotel in SF, and then airfare; I just couldn&#8217;t afford that. Of course, it turns out that cheaper, hackday-only tickets would be made available, but these weren&#8217;t released until March 30, 15 days before the conference<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Far too short notice, and by this time the speaker lineup described above was set, which indicated to me that this wasn&#8217;t a conference for developers like me.</p>

<p>So in this, I saw a pretty big chasm between where I was, and where Twitter was. Before then I hadn&#8217;t quite realized what it was like, but this kinda dumped on me like a ton of bricks.  Getting a bit of the runaround hurt my ego, for sure, and that&#8217;s part of it. I don&#8217;t really think that&#8217;s a good reason to get upset, but I did feel like I had a longstanding relationship with Twitter, and through this, and the way Chirp was being presented, I didn&#8217;t feel like this was the same organization I&#8217;d interacted with for the past three years.</p>

<p>And, well, it wasn&#8217;t. They used to have 6 employees, and now they&#8217;re over 140. Duh.</p>

<p>So with all that, then we have Twitter dropping an enormous bombshell yesterday on their dev community, by creating official clients for both BlackBerry and iPhone. Twitter had done a few things before to add services that had previously been handled by third parties, but in general they&#8217;d had a very hands-off approach with the dev community, sticking with their core features and letting developers handle stuff like url shortening, photo uploading, and &#8212; most significantly &#8212; all non-web clients.  Twitter has enjoyed a very diverse, very organic community of applications and services. Client apps that serve as primary user tools for interacting with Twitter are a very large part of that community. Twitter&#8217;s moves in that space have suddenly and dramatically changed the playing field for all of them.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>There was no warning, and there were no apologies. No statements made to developers that Twitter knew this was going to impact a lot of them; no attempt to unruffle feathers or explain how this was what Twitter needed to do as a company. We did get a couple notes on the dev list, but they could be summed up as follows: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/191bd3c3725de321">&#8220;it happened, now find other things to do.&#8221;</a>  That&#8217;s what angered me more than anything last night.</p>

<p>This really isn&#8217;t about my own client, Spaz. Spaz is <em>not</em> popular, and I doubt even having a directly-competing Official Client on desktop or webOS would impact its numbers &#8211;&#160;folks choose Spaz because they like it, and if they don&#8217;t that&#8217;s fine with me.  Spaz exists as an alternative to closed source, commercial apps, and it&#8217;s even MORE important now that it exists, I think.</p>

<p>I guess it&#8217;s about respect. It&#8217;s about a relationship I had, and I think many of us had, with Twitter, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be there anymore. And that&#8217;s frustrating, and disappointing. But mostly I guess it&#8217;s just sad.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Curiously, this wasn&#8217;t announced on the API announcement mailing list or the twitter dev mailing list; in fact, there was very little information about Chirp posted there.

<p>It would be naive to expect Twitter to not move into other platforms it decides are key to its experience. Or in any other services it decides to do internally.

<p><em>Normally I try to chew on an idea for a post for a few days; it lets me sort out my thoughts and form some kind of thesis. I&#8217;m totally not doing this here, though, so I should preface this with a note that I could be completely off-base. But I don&#8217;t think so.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2010/1/29/future-shock.html">Discussion about how we interact with computers</a> heated up recently with the introduction of the iPad. Lots of nerdy types (myself included) were frustrated that Apple had introduced not a tablet &#8220;computer,&#8221; but a big iPod Touch. They&#8217;re both computers, of course, but the way we interact with them is different: the modern computer interface uses a multitasking windowing motif, and the iPod/iPad interface is fullscreen and single-task focused.</p>

<p>As a Nerdy Power User, I am well-versed in how to navigate a multitasking interface, and for the most part I understand how and why it works the way it does. I, in fact, enjoy learning about the intricacies of these kinds of systems.  So when I use a single-task interface like that of the iPod Touch, I frequently bash my noggin against the barriers it imposes. Copying a URL from the web browser to my Twitter client takes orders of magnitude longer than it would on OS X or Windows, for example.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve learned from interacting with most computer users, though, is that they do not give a rat&#8217;s ass about how computers work. They want to accomplish certain tasks, and will do this in the way that is most sensible and direct for them. And the way they end up accomplishing these tasks within the multitasking window motif is typically not the way <em>I</em> would do it.</p>

<p>The recent fiasco on ReadWriteWeb, where <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">a RWW article</a> became the first Google result for &#8220;facebook login,&#8221; is a classic example of this. And, unfortunately, so is <a href="http://mattstratton.com/hilarity/hundreds-of-facebook-users-are-apparently-really-dumb">the reaction of most Learned Computer Fellows</a>: one of mockery and derision, admonishing the confused users for being stupid, incompetent, or lazy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll admit that I took some glee when I first saw the numerous comments on the article; I love a humorous clusterfuck as much as the next guy. But seeing some of the reactions by the Very Smart Computer People, I began to realize that <strong>We Are Not Getting It</strong>. Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Isn&#8217;t this really a failure of Google? How did it become so easy to game search engine results that an article about Facebook and AOL became the first result for &#8216;facebook login,&#8217; instead of the obvious thing people are actually looking for?</p></li>
<li><p>How is it the fault of the users when we present them with multiple, barely-differentiated text fields within the same window. Is it really surprising that they don&#8217;t understand the differences between each? And is it surprising that they choose to use the one which works with more natural language, rather than entering syntactically-unnatural domain names?</p></li>
<li><p>There is LOADS of anecdotal evidence that most users simply use search engines as a sort of natural language CLI. Shouldn&#8217;t we be designing interfaces that work in the way most natural for the majority of users?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These people have better things to do with their days than tweaking out the spacing in their browser toolbars. A computer for them is a <em>utility</em>. One that is increasingly complex, and one that is used because it&#8217;s the <strong>only</strong> option for accomplishing certain things &#8211; not because it&#8217;s a good option.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of like the Photoshop Problem: when people want to crop a picture, we give them Photoshop.  Photoshop is a behemoth application with nearly every image editing and touchup function imaginable, and it is <em>terribly</em> complex. Now Photoshop is an impressive tool, but only a very tiny percentage people need the power it offers. The vast majority just want to crop their ex-husband from the photo and let their friends look at it.  But even iPhoto, the poster child for Apps So Easy Your Grandparents Can Use Them, continues to pile on features and complexity.</p>

<p>When folks need an elevator, we should give them an elevator, not an airplane. We&#8217;ve been giving them airplanes for 30 years, and then laughing at them for being too stupid to fly them right.</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;re the stupid ones.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>As I said at the start, I wrote this piece a bit off the cuff, so upon further review I think I could have made it a bit clearer. First, a couple great rebuttals I read:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.cursingnerds.com/2010/02/reply-to-funkatrons-analysis-of.html">Reply to Funkatron&#8217;s Analysis of the RWW/Facebook Debacle of 2010</a></li>
<li><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2010/02/16/no-were-not-the-stupid-ones">No, We&#8217;re Not The Stupid Ones</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I posted a comment on Phil Crissman&#8217;s blog, which I think explains a bit further what I&#8217;m thinking, and addresses the notion that some learning may still be required. To copy and paste myself:</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t think that the computer can become (anytime soon) a magic box that determines our whims, nor do I think that people shouldn&#8217;t have to learn some things.</p>

<p>What I do think is that the current interface modern OSes on computers provide is simply overwhelming for most users, to the point that it&#8217;s very challenging to learn how to accomplish tasks without a very significant investment of time. Driving would be a good example of a task that does require investment of time, but is not so overwhelming that the vast majority of people fundamentally get it wrong: you don&#8217;t see people steering with their feet, or accelerating and braking with the radio. I&#8217;d argue that modern computer interfaces, in a rush to offer flexibility and capability, make it possible to steer with your hands, feet, teeth, and knees &#8212; and don&#8217;t make it particularly clear which one is best.</p>

<h3>Update 2</h3>

<p>Your point is well taken. Power features for power users.</p>

<p>The problem is, how to tell which a particular user will be? Kids in particular should have the ability to &#8220;dig deeper.&#8221;  What concerns me isn&#8217;t that the ipod  or the ipad is too simple, it&#8217;s that if it&#8217;s the only computing device that someone grows up WITH how do they learn to manipulate the cybersphere from a position of control AT ALL?</p>

<p>Products like Palm&#8217;s Ares become more and more important in that context.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You have a divide in the software development world as entrenched as the current divisions in the political world. There is the &#8220;make it as flexible as possible&#8221; camp and the &#8220;keep it simple&#8221; camp. The former is represented by the open source development community, cramming as much functionality into what they build as inhumanly impossible, giving developers more  options than they could ever possibly use in a lifetime, making it just as difficult to do something commonplace as it would be to do something complex. The  latter camp is represented by commercial software vendors like Microsoft who push componentized solutions that offer supposed out-of-the-box simplicity but make anything beyond the simplistic nearly impossible to achieve. Ideally, we could build software development platforms that still make simple things simple but simultaneously enable more sophisticated tasks in a methodical way. But we don&#8217;t do that. Instead we have as our alternatives either overly complex open source APIs with steep learning curves or simplistic componentized platforms not capable of much beyond the trivial.</p>

<p>The point being: if we as software developers can&#8217;t find the happy medium between &#8220;keeping the simple things simple&#8221; and &#8220;enabling the complex in a methodical way&#8221; for ourselves, how can we expect to write programs, webapps, and user interfaces that achieve that happy medium for end-users?</p>

<p>Something free and fairly small like Paint.NET does the trick, and if Microsoft had better understanding of what users want, they would have incorporated cropping into their OS photo viewer (as they already have with rotation).</p>

<p>Towards that goal, we&#8217;ve tried to figure out good ways to implement normal vs advanced modes but there are some tough things to balance in there. You have to determine which features belong on which side of that divide and then you have to teach the users to figure out which set they need.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wonderful post.  Really.  I think Apple&#8217;s ahead of the game in bringing really useful functionality to users who consider tech a pain in the ass.  I get the underlying issues we geeks have with their design decisions, but I think we need to accept that they didn&#8217;t design it for us.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m totally exhausted from having my own business plan torn apart all day by venture capitalists, so I&#8217;ll just thank you for putting this idea out there in a way that&#8217;s aimed at the tech crowd.  We keep acting like pushing the usability threshold further away from the ability of a typical average joe will somehow improve things for everyone.  In fact the most interesting technology will bring the masses one or two steps closer to loving technology for the same reasons we all do; it makes our livers that much easier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I commend your example regarding the RWW &#8220;facebook login&#8221; debacle .  Jolie O&#8217;Dell made a similar point in her follow-up article &#8220;The Internet is Hard&#8221; on RWW.  And if you read the comments there (and on the original article), it fell on deaf ears.  Most of the developers, designers, and power-users were convinced that these people were just stupid and that &#8220;you cannot and should not design for stupid&#8221;.   It&#8217;s precisely that sentiment that perpetuates the problem.</p>

<p>Looking at Dave Nattris&#8217; comment about giving someone Paint.NET over Photoshop sort of reinforces why Apple has been so successful with the iPhone/iPod Touch.  Any user can enter the App Store and simply search for &#8220;crop photo&#8221; to find an application that can do this.  The iPad will have the same AppStore and users will be able to search for apps by task/function, download them, and run them.   And it&#8217;s pretty handy for the average user who doesn&#8217;t read the tech rags that all applications have ratings, reviews, and number of downloads.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Funkatron sorry, I don&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re saying. Just because it&#8217;s happened doesn&#8217;t make it right! I don&#8217;t expect all people to understand Photoshop - in fact far from it, as a general IT contractor, I charge people to use the software on their behalf because they don&#8217;t have that knowledge/expertise. What I do expect, though, is that if people want to do things themselves, they need to learn how to do so instead of expecting everything to magically happen. If you want some food, you may not have to go out and pick it from the ground, but you do have to find your way to the supermarket.</p>

<p>@Ankush I don&#8217;t think that situation will be likely, as a &#8216;dumb&#8217; user who wants to crop their photo probably does not know that &#8216;crop&#8217; is the word for trimming their photo. People normally think of a crop being something that&#8217;s grown on a farm (and of course, the reason why it&#8217;s called that is because it gets cropped at harvest time). If we really want to make things easier for people to use on a really dumb level, we have to change the language too. Search engines only work well when you know how to describe what you&#8217;re searching for.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Dave, my feeling is that the complexity presented by the average computer is orders of magnitude beyond going to a grocery store. I&#8217;d also say that an successful grocery store adapts to the way people tend to shop.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m of course not suggesting that there will <em>never</em> be any learning curve, and computers should be usable by infants. I do think that current computer interfaces are, for many reasons, have far too steep a learning curve for most users. There is, I believe, a balance to be struck, and right now we&#8217;re far off that balance.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Dave I agree with you - and perhaps the semantics inherited by the software industry are too domain specific for the average user.  This is a core usability issue in human factors.  Words mean different things to different people.   You and I say &#8220;crop&#8221; while someone else might think of &#8220;trim&#8221; or &#8220;chop&#8221; or &#8220;cut&#8221; or <em>maybe</em> even &#8220;resize&#8221;.</p>

<p>So it furthers the point that @funkatron made about search technology being able to understand context and intent.  For example, if someone types, &#8220;<em>I want to trim my pictures</em>&#8221; into Google or the AppStore&#8217;s search, shouldn&#8217;t they return items that pertain to cropping images?</p>

<p>How we get there is another question.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Your general idea is sound but I disagree with your conclusions.</p>

<p>In the Facebook incident, I feel that as a society, we already pander enough to ignorance. If we attempt to compensate for users who are unable to even discern what website they are on, then we only encourage the spreading of that behavior and we create a software ecosystem that will become utterly and ridiculously complex as we try to account for every possible human error and move to solve it.</p>

<p>As engineers, we should seek to educate the consumers of our products, rather than encourage them to stay in the dark.</p>

<p>But on your point in general, yes, most people just use computers as utility, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they should be absolved from obeying basic rules about what the hell URL they are accessing.</p>

Well, maybe not like microwave ovens—the user interfaces on them often tends to be too abstruse. For that matter, how many readers here remember VCR interfaces and the blinking 12:00? Tunnel-visioned developers have been with us as long as the field of consumer electronics has existed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Michael,</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t disagree with that. I suppose my feeling at the moment is that the complexity of the interface makes it extremely difficult to educate. As someone who works in infosec a fair bit, education of users comes up a lot, and over the years I&#8217;ve felt more and more that the whole model is just fucked.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I&#8217;m not offering much direction, and I suspect much smarter people than me will have better ideas about where to go from here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I recently read an editorial on Engadget (http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/editorial-engadget-on-the-ipad/) where a dozen or so of their staff - &#8216;journalist&#8217; would be too kind a term - gleefully explain how the iPod is not for them.</p>

<p>Of course it&#8217;s not for them. It&#8217;s for everyone in the known universe who doesn&#8217;t read or care about Engadget, its readers and the products it follows. It&#8217;s for all the people out there who want less computing in their lives and not more.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not for the millions of people that like or need to use Windows, Mac OS X or Linux. It&#8217;s for the billions that don&#8217;t. The billions that would rather do anything else on Christmas Day than install Direct X updates so that the kids&#8217; new game runs on the family PC. The billions of people who would rather have their teeth pulled than struggle with security updates and 8-button mice. The billions of people who just want to share pictures of their grandchildren and book tickets for a movie.</p>

<p>In short it&#8217;s for normal people, and they&#8217;re in the majority. We, the developers, designers, content creators and enthusiasts have to understand that we are not normal computer users. We&#8217;re the modern-day equivalent of the auto mechanic, the kit-car fan, or the tuning enthusiast and we&#8217;re sorely outnumbered, by both the young and the old who just want computing to be easier. And for it to waste less of their time.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t see why the computer industry has such a hard time understanding this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I used to think users were stupid, and that one could hardly place the blame at Redmond&#8217;s feet whenever they did something daft and got another obvious virus. Then, as I saw smarter and smarter people fall for it, I realised that this is how it happened.</p>

<p>Microsoft assumed their users would be savvy and relaxed certain things to allow users to bodge around more and this meant more vectors that the regular folk could catch an infection from. Of course it&#8217;s the fault of those who coded Windows and allowed stupid things to happen, and IT departments the world over had to wallpaper over this issue day-in, day-out.</p>

<p>Stuff like this simply shouldn&#8217;t happen, and it&#8217;s our job, as IT people, to make sure it doesn&#8217;t. Much like the dumbing down of cars (oh crap, a car analogy; please forgive me) didn&#8217;t put mechanics out of business or drive people (oops, a pun - it&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;m nearly done) away from designing and improving new cars, the simplification of consumer computers will not lead to a dearth of new programmers. Geeks will be geeks, and the rest can get on with their lives and jobs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I’m really astonished by how many people have proclaimed the end of desktop computing as we know it, despite that so few of them have actually used an iPad.</p>

<p>I agree that there are many things wrong with the usability of modern computers, but did you ever stop to think that some people really are just stupid? Every single person I know can understand the difference between a URL and a Google search.</p>

<p>What’s ironic is that you, like many others, have begun to suggest that we should design computers for the bottom 1% of users (in other words, the ones Googling “facebook login”). How is this any better than designing computers for the top 1% of users (the geeks)?</p>

<p>I’d say <strong>at least</strong> 80% of users (yes, even my mother) use multitasking to some degree, even if it’s limited to a browser window and an instant messaging client, or a word processor and a web browser. And I’m sure that those who don’t understand what multitasking is could have a sufficient grasp of it if they bothered to use their brains for 30 minutes to learn something. Why don’t we just cover cars in rubber, set the speed limit to 10 mph, and let anyone drive without a license?</p>

<p>Yet now that the iPad has come around, everyone is proclaiming how the obvious solution was to just start removing functionality. The iPad doesn’t abstract the manual transmission into an automatic transmission (which is the obligatory car metaphor I keep hearing), it <strong>removes</strong> the transmission.</p>

<p>If Apple had done something truly revolutionary, do you think there would be so many people arguing about its functionality and usability? And please don’t give me this “well back in the day CLI users whined about how inefficient the Mac’s GUI was” because, even today, some things are better done by the CLI, and nothing is <em>preventing</em> me from using a CLI when I want to.</p>

<p>But to be fair, I have not used an iPad either. The only way to know for sure is to wait and see.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Rick Boatwright &#8212; I see this concern come up a lot (what if kids grow up with this kind of tinkering-hostile computing device). I understand it, since I grew up with TRS-80s and computers that you virtually <em>had</em> to tinker with in order to get anything done.</p>

<p>But I think this gives kids, and tinkerers in general, a little too short shrift. People who <em>want</em> to tinker with things will be able to, I suspect; for a few days earlier this week I had a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; app I wrote installed on my iPhone. Even if &#8220;computing appliances&#8221; become the norm, there will obviously be people developing applications for them, and there will almost certainly be ways for people to come up with &#8220;cottage&#8221; applications for them.</p>

<p>My only concern with the iPhone OS devices is with respect to developer licensing &#8212; I think they really need a &#8220;hobbyist&#8221; license of, say, $25 one-time, rather than $99/year, to let people create and sign developer-only certificates that can be used to install apps on individually-provisioned devices. But there&#8217;s no guarantee that the Way Things Are Now is the Way Things Will Always Be &#8212; and of course on non-Apple devices it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> the way things are now. (One could even argue that the recent rewrite of Google Voice as an HTML5 app for the iPhone suggests that it isn&#8217;t entirely the way things are now even on Apple devices.)</p>

<p>&#8220;What I do expect, though, is that if people want to do things themselves, they need to learn how to do so instead of expecting everything to magically happen. If you want some food, you may not have to go out and pick it from the ground, but you do have to find your way to the supermarket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once upon a time people did grow food in their own gardens. Then supermarkets (food stores) came along and some ridiculed the idea that food users would buy stuff shipped for miles when they could <em>just</em> walk out their back door and pick it.</p>

<p>The world changed. Everyone now thinks a FoodStore is normal.</p>

<p>Do keep in mind I didn&#8217;t suggest the iPad was a, or the, solution. Far from it.</p>

<p>In addition, I am definitely not suggesting that some effort may be involved, or that computers should be designed for &#8220;the bottom 1%&#8221; (although I think you vastly underestimate both the intelligence and number of users who have difficulty with modern OSes).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not talking about computers for infants. I&#8217;m talking about computers for non-enthusiasts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Excellent observations Ed!  This web-wide discussion really reveals people&#8217;s critical thinking skills, or the lack thereof.  It&#8217;s fascinating.  I love it.</p>

<p>But get this&#8230; I&#8217;ve been thinking about the old-school premise that it&#8217;s the Marketing Department that should determine what a product should or shouldn&#8217;t do related to optimizing sales.  Stop and think about coming at it from that angle and this discussion gets even more interesting.  AMD (Apple&#8217;s Marketing Department, uh, Steve Jobs?) sees a vast sea of untapped customers -&gt; the non-geeks and tinkerers we&#8217;re talking about here.  They want to optimize for that market.</p>

<p>The iPhone has multitasked from day one, but only under Apple&#8217;s control.  People usually cite the desire to play Pandora in the background while doing something else.  But the AMD says no, we want you to play our iTunes content in the background.</p>

<p>Push Notifications is a brilliant device to delay the need for free-for-all app multitasking and retain control of the interface.  Apple also made it so you don&#8217;t have to leave an app by providing developers with access to the camera, music, photos, contacts, email, maps, the web, etc, delaying the need for multitasking further still.</p>

<p>And is the iPad&#8217;s lovely design faithful and true to the ideal of human-computer interaction, or is it also meeting the goals of the AMD as well?</p>

<p>We have a choice, and the half-dozen existing free-for-all mobile interfaces give the tinkerers what they want, at a cost (e.g. app store spam).  But I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s at least one company that&#8217;s being a butthole about NOT putting out just another free-for-all environment, whether it&#8217;s for an ideal or for a dollar, or both.</p>

<p>And now everyone&#8217;s all ooh-ahh about Windows Phone 7 Series (gotta stop and chuckle for a minute) but in the coming months it&#8217;s fundamental flaws will be revealed and it will, again, be another interface for young people, I suspect.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been nerding around computers for most of my life, and I&#8217;ve started using Google as my URL bar. Why? It requires less thought. And that is precisely all the reason I need.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m ready for my flying cars and personal jetpacks and computing interfaces as simple as toasters. I just don&#8217;t want to bust out the CLI  when I&#8217;m questing for information.</p>

<p>Please, make it simpler for the average Joe to find what he&#8217;s looking for. That does mean writing software to the lowest common denominator&#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t mean the audience is necessarily as stupid as a sack of hammers. Would you ask your local baker or carpenter to put up with virus- and adware-infested cheap-ass Windows machines, and still mock them for trying a notional shortcut of using a browser&#8217;s search bar to get to the Google home page?</p>

<p>Hell, I&#8217;ve done that too.</p>

<p>Designing computing interfaces is <em>hard</em>, and especially when the target is inching toward simplicity but still requires a silly amount of use cases behind the curtain. But that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed&#8230;. no two ways about it. So let&#8217;s live up to the challenge.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It is valuable for readers to be able to choose their level of engagement &#8212; with a book or article, with software.</p>

<p>With a book, this means formatting it so it can be easily skimmed.</p>

<p>With software, this means being able to find the most common operations easily and choose whether (and when) to move to the more complex operations. Photoshop Elements is a good compromise between power and simplicity.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s approach using customizable tool bars, however, strikes me as awkward &#8212; replacing flexibility with a  confusing interface where changes have mainly eccentric significance. It is a difficult thing, offering both stability and flexibility.</p>

<p>One of the needs of users is to have commands stay in place (Stay!) and not appear and disappear or move around in different documents.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of calling people dumb, we should see this as a learning experience. The Internet is a vast world created by the nerdery that broke into the mainstream. Is it really surprising that someone&#8217;s mom or sister doesn&#8217;t use it the same way you do.</p>

<p>When you open a browser window for the first time, you are brought to either Yahoo, Google or MSN or maybe Bing, and what happens with no user interaction at all?&#8230; focus is put on the search bar by the browser. Users are taught from the moment the first get online that the way to find stuff is with the browser search bar.</p>

<p>There is no indication that someone can even type in the address bar. Just because it&#8217;s white I am supposed to know I can type there? And if I want to send someone a link, I don&#8217;t even need to copy and paste it, I just hit file -&gt; send link. Who would even think to interact with the bar?</p>

<p>Maybe if we studied what was happening here, we would work on creating a better user experience, instead of just assuming most people are dumb.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Creating simpler user interfaces isn&#8217;t &#8220;pandering to ignorance.&#8221; It&#8217;s recognizing that while you may enjoy computers for their own sake, other people don&#8217;t. For them, computers are only a means to an end.</p>

<p>This is as it should be. You&#8217;re the one with a job in the industry. They&#8217;re the end users who pay for your expertise. If someone&#8217;s got to find computers and software interesting for their own sake, better it should be you.</p>

<p>You know what the alternative is? Have you ever noticed that the fashion industry is run, not just by, but for, people who find fashion interesting for its own sake? That probably isn&#8217;t you. You just want clothing that will look reasonably good on you, mesh with your existing clothing, and not require you to memorize a bunch of weird rules or go broke paying for dry cleaning.</p>

<p>So much for the beginning of the day, when you&#8217;re getting dressed. At the end of the day, you hope the former Eng. Lit. and Cinema majors who keep a professional eye on your entertainment don&#8217;t forget that you want a decent, fast-moving story and some good lines of dialogue, and that the cook at your local restaurant doesn&#8217;t go hog-wild with organ meats and obscure vegetables.</p>

<p>In short, forgive as you hope to be forgiven. We all look like stupid barbarians to someone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One thing people keep forgetting is iPad is a computerized pad of paper, in the same way an iPod is a computerized music box. There is no excuse for adding a computer to these everyday items and making them harder to use. You don&#8217;t have to learn how to make paper, ink, or how to set hot type in order to read a book.</p>

<p>&gt; if [iPad is] the only computing
&gt; device that someone grows up WITH how do they learn
&gt; to manipulate the cybersphere from a position of
&gt; control AT ALL?</p>

<p>That is the same exact &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; argument that was made against the World Wide Web in the 1990&#8217;s and the Mac in the 1980&#8217;s and the personal computer in the 1970&#8217;s. You&#8217;re making me think the iPad will be a huge success.</p>

<p>&gt; What I do expect, though, is that if people want to
&gt; do things themselves, they need to learn how to do
&gt; so instead of expecting everything to magically happen.</p>

<p>People seem pretty happy to learn how to do things themselves on an iPhone. But wow do they hate learning how to do things with a PC. The difference is the additional CS/I-T work that is forced upon them or not.</p>

<p>&gt; you, like many others, have
&gt; begun to suggest that we should design computers
&gt; for the bottom 1% of users</p>

<p>That is a perfect example of computer science nerd imperialism at its worst.</p>

<p>People who don&#8217;t want to learn computer science are more like 90%, and they&#8217;re not below you in any way, many are much, much smarter than you. They have special skills that aren&#8217;t computer science skills. You should not look down on them because they don&#8217;t want to swing the same CS/I-T wrench that you swing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working with an I-T group at a law firm right now, and there isn&#8217;t a single lawyer here who can run a PC. We can say they are stupid or we can admit that there hasn&#8217;t been a computer good enough to replace their common task of annotating 300 page documents. Word/Acrobat with a mouse is not it. iPad may do it with a virtual 300 page document they can manipulate like the paper version.</p>

<p>I play the piano and often have a piano keyboard plugged into my computer. Imagine if that was the primary computer interface and I said no computer for you until you learn to play the piano!</p>

<p>&gt; As engineers, we should seek to educate the
&gt; consumers of our products, rather than encourage
&gt; them to stay in the dark.</p>

<p>This is the same logic that a cat uses when they bring you a mouse. Do you eat the mouse?</p>

<p>People are not &#8220;in the dark&#8221; about engineering. You will not enlighten them by teaching them engineering. They&#8217;ve heard of it. They are not interested, or else they would be engineers.</p>

<p>The solution is to design your products so that the users don&#8217;t have to be engineers. Otherwise you are just being lazy, pushing unfinished engineering work down the line to the user.</p>

<p>&gt; I’d say at least 80% of users (yes, even my mother)
&gt; use multitasking to some degree,</p>

<p>Every single iPhone OS user, all 100%, uses multitasking all day long. A very, very common task is to talk on the phone with someone while reading an email they sent you earlier. It&#8217;s common to have the iPod playing all the time, and iTunes downloading a movie while you do something else.</p>

<p>Second, you&#8217;re talking about computer tasks, not user tasks. Users multitask with their iPhones by running 50 apps in a day as they go about their business and the device never stalls, never slows down, never interrupts their multitasking by asking them to help the computer manage its multiple tasks.</p>

<p>Further, the success of the App Store is because users are running MORE apps than they do on Mac/PC, not less. Users who have no 3rd party apps on their Mac/PC have dozens or hundreds on their iPhone.</p>

<p>The truth is, most users do not know what it means for an app to be &#8220;running&#8221; or not. That is deeply computer science based. You have to know about RAM and processes. They don&#8217;t know that the reason their computer has slowed down is an app they used 3 days ago for 5 minutes is still running.</p>

<p>&gt; Yet now that the iPad has come around, everyone
&gt; is proclaiming how the obvious solution was to just
&gt; start removing functionality</p>

<p>No, no functionality has been removed. The only difference between iPhone OS and Mac OS is the top layer, the user interface, which is built for touch. The bottom layers are the same OS X.</p>

<p>&gt; nothing is preventing me from using a CLI when I
&gt; want to.</p>

<p>CLI is there but it&#8217;s an add-on. The Cisco guy already drooled all over this right after the iPad launch. You can run a whole PC desktop over VPN on iPad and have 52 Linux CLI&#8217;s if you want.</p>

<p>Your PC doesn&#8217;t have touch but you don&#8217;t say that Dell is preventing you from using touch, do you? You add it if you want it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Everyone is overlooking the fact that readers  can use Facebook Connect to leave comments on the ReadWriteWeb page in question. No wonder people were confused!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just that they Googled &#8220;Facebook Login&#8221; and came to that RWW page; it&#8217;s also that there is a legitimate Facebook login form at the bottom of the page—with the Facebook logo!</p>

<p>There are (at least) two failures of design here:
1. We haven&#8217;t taught people how to use a URL to determine what page they&#8217;re on.
2. We haven&#8217;t effectively communicated that you can use federated login schemes, like Facebook Connect or OpenID, to login to various sites with a single, universal key. This is a pretty complex concept that I don&#8217;t expect a lot of people to understand—in terms of how it really works behind the scenes.</p>

<p>In other words, there are two web design problems that need better solutions:
1. Helping people find what they want.
2. Simplifying or eliminating the need to login.</p>

<p>Yes, and saying that children shouldn’t be allowed to drive is adult imperialism at its worst. The difficulty of making such a system safe for children to use far outweighs the benefits of kids driving around by themselves.</p>

<p><strong>“People who don’t want to learn computer science are more like 90%, and they’re not below you in any way, many are much, much smarter than you. They have special skills that aren’t computer science skills. You should not look down on them because they don’t want to swing the same CS/I-T wrench that you swing.”</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for insulting my intelligence, and assuming I’m some IT drone. Again, I know plenty of people who know <em>nothing</em> about the nitty-gritty of computers, yet somehow seem to manage to use a computer. Similarly, I have almost no understanding of how an automobile works. Miraculously, I can still drive one. I’d hazard a guess that most creative professionals are power users. And yet… I see very few of them with CS degrees.</p>

<p><strong>“iPad may do it with a virtual 300 page document they can manipulate like the paper version.”</strong></p>

<p>Yes! The touch interface really is amazing! And I don’t mean that sarcastically, either. But why does functionality for those of us who can take advantage of it have to suffer?</p>

<p><strong>“Every single iPhone OS user, all 100%, uses multitasking all day long.” … “Second, you’re talking about computer tasks, not user tasks. Users multitask with their iPhones by running 50 apps in a day as they go about their business and the device never stalls, never slows down, never interrupts their multitasking by asking them to help the computer manage its multiple tasks.”</strong></p>

<p>No, <strong>you</strong> are talking about computer tasks, not user tasks. I’m well aware that the iPhone can perform certain tasks in the background. And for the iPhone, this is sufficient. The iPad, on the other hand, has ample screen real estate and a significantly faster processor than the iPhone. If I want to view two documents side by side, I can’t. It doesn’t even matter if they’re both Pages documents. If I want to use an email as a reference for something I’m writing… I can’t. If I want to perform research on the Internet and make an outline or write notes… I can’t.</p>

<p>Or more accurately, I can. After switching the home screen, finding the other App I’m trying to work in, and opening that. And then I have to switch back again. That way of working is fine for the iPhone, but I don’t think it’s the best solution for the iPad. In fact, functionality would be far improved if there was only a way to quickly switch contexts… the apps don’t even need to run in the background so long as they can maintain a persistent state.</p>

<p><strong>“No, no functionality has been removed. The only difference between iPhone OS and Mac OS is the top layer, the user interface, which is built for touch. The bottom layers are the same OS X.”</strong></p>

<p>I’m arguing that the graphical interface that is to be the successor to the multi-windowed interfaces of today is far too simplified. Again, I have to jump through hoops to do something as simple as work with two documents at once. I don’t care if it won’t run three servers and a filesharing client in the background while idling on 22 irc channels for three weeks. You may find this hard to believe, but there are legitimate reasons for multitasking that aren’t only for “computer science nerd imperialists”.</p>

<p><strong>“CLI is there but it’s an add-on. The Cisco guy already drooled all over this right after the iPad launch. You can run a whole PC desktop over VPN on iPad and have 52 Linux CLI’s if you want.”</strong></p>

<p>If the rest of my life is to be spent jumping through hoops to connect to some server to work on something that doesn’t fit the iPhone OS’s unitasking restriction, I might as well quit while I’m ahead.</p>

<p><strong>“Your PC doesn’t have touch but you don’t say that Dell is preventing you from using touch, do you? You add it if you want it.”</strong></p>

<p>If I want to change something about Mac OS X, I can. In fact, I don’t even have to use Mac OS X… I can do whatever I want to my hardware. But the iPad won’t even let the hackers have their fun. It’s Apple’s way or the highway. I can’t even launch my own applications without Apple’s consent and $99 in their direction. Yes, I’m not being <em>forced</em> to use the iPad, but why start down such a slippery slope?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think Apple deserves a lot of credit for the UX, but the locked-downness of it is a terrible trend, something that could destroy the exact openness and freedom that made something like the iPad viable. What if, in the end, tools like the iPad turn TCP/IP into Apple/IP®? Because, after all, that&#8217;s where the strategy of Cocoa Touch is headed. You don&#8217;t need open standards when people can only do a limited number of things with a device like the iPad.</p>

<p>Freedom includes the right to be stupid. There is no such right in the iPad world. If we have to put up with a fraction of the people trying to log into a news article, I say it&#8217;s well worth it. If this is being stupid, I am stupid and remain wary of those who would have me be &#8220;smart&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve rechecked the text of my first comment. It isn&#8217;t just missing its first line. It&#8217;s also missing a couple of minor changes I made further on in the text. That is: it&#8217;s my first draft.</p>

<p>Sequence: I wrote the first draft in the text entry box, reviewed it in &#8220;preview&#8221; mode, and added a new first line and made some other minor changes to it in the text entry box. I then hit &#8220;submit&#8221; without previewing my edited version.</p>

<p>My guess is that the version in &#8220;preview&#8221; was what got posted, rather than the revised version in the text entry box.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;I’d argue that modern computer interfaces, in a rush to offer flexibility and capability, make it possible to steer with your hands, feet, teeth, and knees — and don’t make it particularly clear which one is best.&#8221;</p>

<p>I fully agree. Computers are created by nerds for nerds who think that regular humans should think like they do, but don&#8217;t and mostly can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same as someone knowing a spoken language that is different than what most people grew up with, pick a country that has a language that is quite different than your own, and expects you to learn the language and use their product. It just isn&#8217;t a sane premise.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ian,</p>

<p>I am an IT professional, having worked at desktop/user support for over 15 years on both Mac and Windows OSes.</p>

<p>I agree that your attitude displays the very worst of the old guard&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m king of the hill&#8221; attitude.</p>

<p>Face it, IT pros aren&#8217;t king any more.  There are a LOT more of the regular folks than there are It pros.  Software SHOULD be written for the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p>Not to say that apps for the geeks won&#8217;t be written.  Geez, we&#8217;ve gotta have tools to do our jobs too!</p>

<p>But,</p>

<p>&#8220;If I want to change something about Mac OS X, I can. In fact, I don’t even have to use Mac OS X… I can do whatever I want to my hardware. But the iPad won’t even let the hackers have their fun. It’s Apple’s way or the highway. I can’t even launch my own applications without Apple’s consent and $99 in their direction. Yes, I’m not being forced to use the iPad, but why start down such a slippery slope?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously, that tool (the iPad) hasn&#8217;t been designed for YOU, but for the mass of users that Apple wants to target, which is the point of this article!  I strongly feel that the iPad WILL be a huge success, and marks the future (or the beginnings of such) of computing.</p>

<p>Remember the KISS principle?  Apple&#8217;s got it down pat, and anybody that wants to sell computers and software to run on them in the future had better remember it, cause that&#8217;s what people want.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been in support roles helping the common user for over 15 years, and most of them were WAY smarter than me.  But they don&#8217;t have the TIME to learn my way of doing things, nor do they want to even if they did.  They prefer for it to be easy, simple, so they can go on with the really important things they want to do.</p>

<p>Klutzing around with a box that requires a full time desktop tech to keep it running isn&#8217;t, believe me, what they really want, its the LAST thing.</p>

<p>And they shouldn&#8217;t have to, either.</p>

<p>Ed is fully right about this.</p>

<p>The same goes for Information Technology - you can pay over the odds for an Apple mobile device that speaks your language, but won&#8217;t do exactly what you might need of it, or you can buy a Microsoft/Google/Linux OS device that gives you much more control but you will have to figure a few things out.</p>

<p>If you want to drive a car, you have to take a written and practical test (in the UK at least), to prove you know how to operate it. Why? Because you could cause harm to yourself and others. The same goes for guns, certain types of machinery etc. I don&#8217;t see why digital devices are any different, or the Internet for that matter. It is unreasonable to expect a system to cater for your every need without having to learn a single thing. I would love there to be a legally required qualification to use an online device (as again you can possibly harm others as well as yourself) - and it&#8217;s a tribute to most user interfaces that users can usually figure them out pretty well without any formal training.</p>

<p>No Dave. You have it wrong. You are the foreigner invading another country with your other language. These people that are using computers … they existed BEFORE you and they will exist AFTER you. You are the one that didn&#8217;t learn their language, the native language and you expect everyone around you to learn your, not their language. That&#8217;s why computer software is so ****** up.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@OlsonBW No, sorry, it is not natural or normal for a organic human creature to edit a digital image on a LCD using a piece of plastic with a ball inside. This is new territory here for the human race, with new rules.</p>

<p>The foreign country is the digital world, and it has its own languages. Software tries to model the real world as much as possible, but at the end of the day there are abstract concepts in software that either don&#8217;t exist in the real world, or that do but the common person rarely if ever encounters them.</p>

<p>Computers have allowed us to become image manipulators, for instance. This used to be something that only skilled professionals can do, so it&#8217;s perfectly fair that if you want to have a go at it yourself, now that the equipment is available cheaply/for free, you should have some idea about how it works. Of course, you can just figure out for yourself, as most people do, but that&#8217;s your choice. Photoshop is for skilled professionals, not untrained amateurs.</p>

Not their Office software which is most certainly bloated and overly complicated and as guilty as every one of the crimes that sadly some people here are proudly advocating. I was comparing the tools developers use for building application: the typical (and this IS a generalization) open source API/framework for developing software, designed to be SO powerful and flexible that it becomes a Sisyphean/Herculean task just to do something trivial (like set up and run the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; app), versus a Microsoft .NET style &#8220;widgety&#8221; approach in which a salesman can walk in and say &#8220;See? I&#8217;ve just built you a storefront app! Buy this from me!&#8221; - but when you try to customize the damned thing according to your requirements, armies of outside Microsoft-trained consultants need to be thrown at the project to make it the way you want it (and it still doesn&#8217;t work in the end).</p>

<p>My point was that if we as developers cannot get our act together to supply ourselves with APIs and frameworks that are &#8220;right-sized&#8221; for what we&#8217;re trying to do, that make simple tasks simple but are still customizable and extensible in an orderly fashion when more advanced work needs to be done, then how can we expect to build software for END-USERS that is right-sized and right-functioned for them?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>i dont think the car example is really very accurate.  sure, operating a motor vehicle isn&#8217;t tremendously difficult, but we still make everyone take a class to learn how to drive and we make them pass two test before giving them the privilege to drive on roads. we do this because driving is a complex activity and a lot of people screw it up, even after extensive training.</p>

<p>sure, its easy to say that its our fault for not making it simpler.  but we&#8217;re fighting battles between simplicity and utility.  sure, you can simplify something until it can&#8217;t do anything at all. a computer with one button is simple. but it can&#8217;t do much.  its easy to say that it all should be simpler, but maybe simple isn&#8217;t as possible as you think.  maybe complex is what is necessary and the solution is that some people will have to take a class and pass two tests before being able to navigate the system well enough to accomplish their goals.</p>

@Matěj Cepl - I guess I wasn’t clear about what aspects of the Microsoft product line I was referring to. Not their Office software which is most certainly bloated and overly complicated and as guilty as every one of the crimes that sadly some people here are proudly advocating. I was comparing the tools developers use for building application:&#8221;</p>

<p>Rich - I couldn&#8217;t agree more. The concept of how you make programs with current compilers, ANY compilers, is still in the dark ages at best. Until compilers get up to and past the Model T stage there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of hope that most programmers will be able to make a really good program that isn&#8217;t way too slow or too buggy.</p>

<p>Way too much of a developers time is spent on memory management. In fact any time at all that is spent on memory management is wasted time.</p>

<p>LET ME FINISH.</p>

<p>When you drive to a store or even go to a website. Do you write down every single thing about what you are going to do to get there? Do you manage all of your thought processes? Do you manage every inch of finger movement to get the job done?</p>

<p>If you do you need serious help or have a some kind of brain issue. I don&#8217;t mean that in a mean way, just an honest way.</p>

<p>In real life you concentrate on what you want to get done. Where you want to go either in a car or on the internet. Your brain has learned long ago how to do most stuff behind the scenes. For the most part, unless you are having an off day, you don&#8217;t pay attention to the little details. Or at least don&#8217;t have to.</p>

<p>Now, with compilers, you DO have to think about all the little things. How long have programmers been programming? Since the 50s or even before? It is about time that compilers get their act together and take care of ALL memory management and all the little things that you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about. A programmers focus should only have to be on what they are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>Until they are freed to do exactly that, well, they won&#8217;t have the time to be truely innovative.</p>

<p>PS: Yes I know there is compiler X or Y. No compiler is up to snuff yet. I won&#8217;t argue about it. If you think otherwise you just have your head in the sand and are a glutton for punishment. Be honest though. Don&#8217;t you Wish that you could concentrate on just what you want to create instead of all the other stuff you have to do just to get it to work? That&#8217;s what I am talking about. Programmers of the future won&#8217;t have to do this. The question is how long it will take.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@OlsonBW: While I think your comment may be considered ancillary to the subject of this particular thread, I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more. My focus was not so much on the compilers (though even languages that supposedly manage memory and such for you will still require tinkering when it comes to real world performance tuning) but on the higher-level abstractions for building applications. Our choices seem to be:</p>

<p>1) A Microsofty salesy widget-driven &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; framework that a salesperson could easily demonstrate to a potential client. &#8220;Look, here&#8217;s your whole website, it will just take a few weeks to customize it the way you want. Where&#8217;s my money?&#8221; In the end, the project will require years of efforts with more bodies brought in than necessary because it turns out customization of these pre-built widgets is nearly impossible meaning you have to work from scratch.</p>

<p>2) An open source and/or Java/JEE based approach that has all the bells and whistles you could possibly imagine. When it comes time to demo it to management, it takes four weeks to get the Hello World app running and another month to showcase a skeleton of the site looking as if&#8230; well, as if developers designed it. It also requires years of effort because the lack of solid documentation makes it impossible to get anything done, plus the codebase changes over the lifetime of the project without regard to backward compatibility.</p>

<p>All this verbiage is ALSO an ancillary point relative to the subject matter of this thread, but the real point is this: if we as developers cannot build application development platforms FOR OURSELVES that are right-sized and right-functioned, what hope is there that we can build applications and interfaces for end-users that have those same qualities? That&#8217;s the point I was trying to make.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, apropos another comment of yours, @OlsonBW: never mind @Dave has to say, you got it right on the money. &#8220;You are the foreigner invading another country with your other language. You are the one that didn’t learn their language, the native language and you expect everyone around you to learn your, not their language. That’s why computer software is so ****** up.&#8221; Well said.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a test: If users of your email client, social networking interface, or other messaging program try to drag an image from another window into messages they are composing, and this doesn&#8217;t work in your application the way you wrote it, do you:</p>

<p>A) &#8220;educate&#8221; the user that what he&#8217;s doing is wrong, by badgering them with explanations about the HTTP protocol, Einsteinian relativity, the internal combustion engine, and how PHP works (or doesn&#8217;t) - in the hopes that these people (that you obviously think are not as smart as you are) will understand the world the way you do and learn the &#8220;right&#8221; way to use your product, or&#8230;</p>

<p>B) observe usage patterns for your product in the user community and enhance the product to provide the functionality that users want and need based on those observations, learning from what your users expect from your product rather than dictating to them how they should use it?</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be surprised how many developers would answer A!</p>

<p>(Actually, no, you wouldn&#8217;t. :-( Look at the discussions some people spawned off of this one, unapologetically mocking users, referring to them as ignorant, and posturing themselves as the uber-intelligent vanguard protecting the world from a future out of the film &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221;. Laughable.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure some out there are shouting &#8220;but I&#8217;m a knowledgeable developer, that&#8217;s something I would have known to do in my code!&#8221; The point is that this is just an example, one based on knowledge we already have about user behaviors. There are examples out there that we haven&#8217;t witnessed yet, and it&#8217;s arrogant and foolhardy to believe that you as a developer will know everything about what the users should be doing with your code, before they do.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s somewhat refreshing to see that many developers ARE getting the idea that the user is the focus, not them; that the &#8220;right&#8221; way to use software emerges and evolves from observations about what users do and want to do with software, not from Biblical edicts from developers that dictate right vs. wrong. At the same time, it&#8217;s sad to see some developers get even more entrenched in their deprecated attitudes about who needs to be &#8220;educated&#8221; about what.</p>

But if, once its in the wild and people are using it for something it was not designed for or in a way not anticipated, lots of people, then it would behoove the developers to take this into account rather than call the users stupid.  Using Google to find the login page to something I forgot to bookmark is a really common example of this. I might do this dozens of times for the same page until I finally get to bookmark it. I am sure I am not alone.  I think a lot of functionality could be gained from looking at how people actually use technology rather than demeaning them for not doing it how they are supposed to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I believe it was Roy Batty in Blade Runner who said to J.S. Sebastian, &#8220;We are not computers;  We&#8217;re physical&#8221;.  And to Phillip K. Dick&#8217;s point - humans are physical as well.  Part of being physical and interfacing with the physical world is the expectation that the interfaces around us are relatively dumb and static.  Computer interfaces are adaptive and dynamic - driven by user choices and increasingly by algorithmic inference - and presenting information/feedback in dynamic ways.    This dynamism is the strength of
computers - but it&#8217;s also a weakness if the interaction is so abstract
that it alienates or confuses the user.</p>

<p>The foreign country analogy is fairly accurate.  However, isn&#8217;t the entire point of technology to lower the bar to the point where interaction is easy and seamless so we don&#8217;t have to worry about the language we speak?  Otherwise, what&#8217;s the point of using technology?  If I want to read the news and I have to jump through hoops to do it, why not just pickup the newspaper instead?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Rich, bravo! I&#8217;ve tangled with my share of obstinate condescending purists who could care less about users and their input (including one of the spawners of bad attitude you mention in your post). Your all too realistic A/B test is one the majority of developers I&#8217;ve worked with would sadly fail. I also agree with you about development tools, we are in a quagmire where the options available to us are at opposite poles neither of which can accomplish what we want.</p>

<p>@Victoria, bravo to you too. I don&#8217;t know if you realize how reasonable it would be to have web applications like the Google home page do exactly what you describe. Cookies could be created based on an observed usage pattern when you type in &#8220;facebook login&#8221;, noting that every time you perform that search, you click on the link to the Facebook login page. An area at the top of the page presented when this search is performed could highlight the link you usually click, even if it is no longer the top result of the search.</p>

<p>But can&#8217;t you already hear the screams and yowls of the condescending purists? &#8220;NO NO NO NO NO!!! A search engine front end isn&#8217;t supposed to do things like that, that&#8217;s WRONG, it offends my religious sensibilities, please let me hit this ignorant user over the head until she understands the RIGHT way to use this page!&#8221; In calling users stupid and ignorant for not following a purist religious code about how the internet shold be used, these people ensure that they will never be asked to work on user-facing software projects that MATTER. At least we can only hope they don&#8217;t!</p>

<p>Last but not least, @Ankush, I would change your wording only slightly: Computer interfaces are SUPPOSED TO BE adaptive and dynamic. When they are, that&#8217;s fantastic, and when they&#8217;re not, that&#8217;s one place where there&#8217;s room for improvement.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great post, I came via a line on my fav writing site.</p>

<p>Someone&#8217;s post in the great list above talked about kids learning to use the &#8216;easy way&#8217; simple interfaces before learning how the process works reminds me of a tale from my own days of learning how to use computers &#8230;</p>

<p>Let us return to when dinosaurs walked the earth:</p>

<p>I never touched a computer before college.  In college, I had to learn &#8230; GASP &#8230; DOS as my method of interfacing with the blinking green (or amber) screen.  I learned it fairly quickly and easily and soon could go and do just about all that I needed.  (To put this in perspective, I installed my first hard drive with a screwdriver and a butterknife and thought those 10 megs of computer might would last forever.)</p>

<p>Then came Windows 3.1.  I was in the biz world by then and disdained the cute little cursors.  I know DOS after all!</p>

<p>A couple of years later, a fresh-out-of-school colleague threw an F-5 fit when his computer locked up.  He thought his files were gone forever because nothing happened when he clicked on the document icon.</p>

<p>I pulled out my butterknife (figuratively, not literally), pulled up a DOS prompt and rescued all of his files onto a floppy in about a dozen keystrokes.  He looked at me like I was a wizard and a genius all wrapped up into one package.  Gee &#8230; I&#8217;m awesome &#8230;</p>

<p>The moral of this tale (other than helping me avoid work?)  Yes, the computer is a tool.  However, I think it is important to make kids muddle through some of the hard stuff before you hand them the easy stuff on a platter.  Like learning your multiplication tables before picking up a calculator.</p>

<p>On the flip side though, overloading power programs for everyday use is just as bad.  I am a fairly competent photoshop and dreamweaver user.  However, I no longer want to start with a blank screen every time I need a web page.  Since I am comfortable with the fundamentals, I&#8217;ve picked up a couple of cheap WYSIWYG programs that incorporate the basics of photoshop, dreamweaver, and flash into a point-drag-click-publish that saves me a lot of time and debugging.</p>

<p>Rambling rant over!  Great post, I&#8217;ll be back.  Terri</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have to agree with your point to some extend.</p>

<p>Yes, we should give the users the simplest interface so they can use whatever the software is. I&#8217;ve tried that approach and it tends to work&#8230;. for a while. After that, the user tells you how restrictive the software is and how nice it would be if it could do &#8220;whatever&#8221; out of the box.
So you try to accomodate the user and add the new functionality which makes the interface a bit more complex.
And then another one.
And another one.
And finally you end-up making the software even more complex that it would have been in the first place by adding functionalities on and on to an interface that hasn&#8217;t been designed to  receive that many functionalities.</p>

   I agree with your assessment.</p>

<p>Emmanuel, 
    We as developers need to learn how to do market research and be psychologist. If the user wants X, he may not really. Many psychologist will tell you most people may wish for something but their behavior tells you a different story. We all want an airplane, but do you want to train for 2+ years or less than a month to get into the driver seat? We need to build cars for people even when they demanded a plane&#8230; we are the stupid ones!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy to announce that <a href="http://twitter.com/ronaldDevera">Ron Devera</a> has agreed to become the UI Lead for Spaz Desktop.</p>

<p>Spaz has been a very informally organized project since I began it back in spring 2007. A number of people have contributed important pieces of code, and support was primarily handled by <a href="http://twitter.com/kibitzer">@kibitzer</a> for over a year.</p>

<p>So why a title and all that? It seems like a good idea at the moment. I&#8217;ve been trying to establish more structure in the development and support efforts of Spaz to make it easier for others to contribute, including <a href="http://spaz.lighthouseapp.com">Lighthouse (development coordination)</a> and <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com">Tender (user support)</a> sites where volunteers can see who needs help and what needs to be done. Adding an &#8220;official&#8221; team member is a part of these efforts.</p>

<p>Ron is a smart, talented developer, with a diverse set of skills, and he&#8217;s demonstrated an ongoing commitment to making his contributed &#8220;Leopaz&#8221; theme very high-quality. He&#8217;s a strong JavaScript, Ruby and HTML/CSS dev, and his attention to detail has made Leopaz the strongest theme Spaz offers. I&#8217;m very excited about having him a part of the team.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t like to toot my own horn. Well, actually I do, but I&#8217;m also embarassed by it, so writing the title for this post was a bit painful. Nevertheless, I do think it&#8217;s accurate: Spaz webOS 1.0 is now available in the Palm App Catalog, and that&#8217;s a significant milestone for the project, and for open source on webOS.</p>

<p>I first started playing with webOS a year ago, over Christmas break at my day job. In June, Spaz webOS was in the App Catalog at release, and back then I was quite proud of the fact that we&#8217;d been able to ship a truly open source, transparent app on the first day of a new platform. And now, a year since I first cobbled together a Hello World in Mojo, Spaz has reached a reasonable level of maturity &#8211; at least as mature as something called &#8220;Spaz&#8221; will ever have.</p>

<p>Originally I was going to call this release v0.6. I am shy of using 1.0 because I am painfully aware of all the flaws in my software, and it certainly never feels &#8220;done&#8221; or &#8220;ready&#8221; to me. However, a recent discussion with <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog">Keith Casey</a> led me to think more seriously about using the &#8220;1.0&#8221; designation &#8211;&#160;Spaz webOS is very much Safe To Use, but a pre-1.0 version might make some potential users to think otherwise.</p>

<p>And potential users are a bit more of a consideration now, because in a couple weeks (probably the week of January 11), <strong>Spaz webOS will start charging $2 for App Catalog downloads in the United States</strong>. This is something I&#8217;ve been planning for a while, but it&#8217;s still stepping out a bit, both for me (I&#8217;ve never charged for software before) and for open source software in general. To be clear, here&#8217;s how it will work:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Spaz webOS will cost $2 to download in App Catalog markets that support payments</strong>. Right now the only market that supports payments is the US.  It will be free in all other markets.</li>
<li><strong>Spaz will still be completely open source.</strong> <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">The full source code</a> will always be available.</li>
<li><strong>I will not stop users from packaging and installing Spaz webOS themselves.</strong> In fact, I encourage it! I always need more testers, designers and developers. Hacking, patching, and messing with Spaz are fully endorsed. If you can&#8217;t help in one of these ways, consider <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore">donating to the SpazCore project</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue made from paid App Catalog downloads will be used to support development and offset equipment and hosting costs.</strong> I&#8217;ve never made any money from Spaz, and despite some generous donations over the past couple years, I&#8217;m still well in the red. I don&#8217;t do this for the money (obviously), but lightening the burden and compensating myself and other people who have given their time for Spaz is reasonable, I think.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another thing that isn&#8217;t changing is the principles that guide the Spaz project. I wrote up a <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/the-spaz-project-statement-of-purpose/">statement of purpose</a> a while, back, which I&#8217;ll replicate here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Spaz was built for the sake of building it. It is not a means to an end. However, creating it has had several good consequences.</li>
  <li>Spaz demonstrates that making things is good, and sharing how you make them is better.</li>
  <li>Spaz is a necessary counter to closed, hidden technologies. Spaz must always be open.</li>
  <li>The value of Spaz does not lie in the judgements of others, but in the process of building it, and the enjoyment derived by those who use it.</li>
  <li>We welcome anyone who wishes to participate in the Spaz Project with open arms, as long as they understand and respect the purposes of the project.</li>
  <li>The Spaz project values clear and open communication between participants.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is how I think software should be made</strong>. If you agree, I hope you&#8217;ll consider supporting what we&#8217;re doing in a way you see fit. We always need help!</p>

<p>Thank you for making Spaz far more than I could have imagined.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Did I say that? I actually knew very well that a week later, I would be traveling to San Jose for <a href="http://zendcon.com">ZendCon 09</a>. Foolish me.</p>

<p>I spoke at ZendCon on Building Desktop RIAs with JavaScript and PHP. I&#8217;ve given this talk other places, but this time I showed off some fun PHP-powered jQuery within Titanium. Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/php"&gt;        
    /**
     * run the passed function when DOM Ready event runs 
     */
    $jQuery()-&gt;ready( function () use (&amp;$jQuery) {
        /**
         * set some CSS properties 
         */
        $jQuery('#phpjQ')-&gt;css('display', 'none')
                        -&gt;css('background-color','#333')
                        -&gt;css('padding','10px')
                        -&gt;css('border','2px solid #000');
        /**
         * bind a delegated click event to the passed function 
         */
        $jQuery('#invokePHP')-&gt;live('click', function () use (&amp;$jQuery) {
            /**
             * set the text color and reveal 
             */
            $jQuery('#phpjQ')-&gt;css('color', 'red')-&gt;slideToggle(500);
        } );                
    } );
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Unlike some <a href="http://blog.calevans.com/category/codeworks/">others</a>, I only participated halfway in CodeWorks 09, doing the east coast leg of Atlanta, Miami, Washington, D.C., and New York City. It was an enjoyable adventure, and I liked being able to try different approaches in my talks and see what worked best.</p>

<p>I was able to record audio with the voice memo app on my iPhone. Getting hour-long recordings off is a bit of an adventure &#8211; they refuse to appear in the voice memo playlist in iTunes, so you have to find the files in the MobileSync backups folders and do some renaming work &#8211; but they turned out pretty well.</p>

<p>Yesterday I put together a short survey that asked some questions about what people would be willing to pay for Spaz webOS. It&#8217;s been my plan all long to change a small fee (when possible &#8212; you can&#8217;t yet in the Palm App Catalog) for Spaz webOS, and use the revenue to support further development. Since I believe strongly that Spaz must be an open, transparent project, here are the results so far from 145 responses:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/Spaz-webOS_Pricing_Survey_Results-20090731.pdf">PDF of Spaz webOS Pricing Survey Response Summary data</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230;and here are some comments on the results:</p>

<h4>What is the most you would pay to purchase Spaz in the Palm App Catalog?</h4>

<p>From doing a little math on this, it seems like $2 is the optimal price point in terms of revenue generation, followed closely by $3.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/Spaz-webOS_Revenue_Potential.pdf">PDF of &#8220;revenue potential&#8221; data</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>What 1-3 features would make you more likely to purchase Spaz in the app catalog?</h4>

<p>First off, lots of people ignored the request to pick 1-3, which isn&#8217;t surprising (you couldn&#8217;t set a max number of choices). That being said, 4 items were far and away the most popular choices</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Faster Performance (56%)</strong><br />
Spaz does seem to perform slower than comparable apps. Part of this is because we use a combined timeline, and therefore it takes longer to build results. We also initially requested a LOT more messages from Twitter at startup than comparable apps, and processing them takes more time. We&#8217;ve lowered the default numbers (you can up them in prefs), but it&#8217;s still higher.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also had some CPU usage issues. Those have been dramatically lowered since initial release, but there&#8217;s probably more we can do. This shows up especially while processing new messages.</p>

<p>The other issue I think this response refers to is sluggish scrolling speed. This one perplexes me a bit, but I&#8217;m guessing we may be running into performance limits of the Pre&#8217;s webkit renderer. We&#8217;re going to do some experiments with stripping out CSS styling and markup on our timelines to see if the scroll speed improves in either case. If so, we will need to modify how we style and/or build the markup for our timeline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Direct uploading to image hosting services like Twitpic (54%)</strong><br />
This was <em>really</em> close to #1, which tells you how badly the lack of direct file upload APIs in webOS is hurting devs. What&#8217;s most frustrating is that the email-based workarounds actually took longer to implement than direct uploads would &#8212; we already have plenty of code from the desktop app we could have adapted. Here&#8217;s another plead to Palm to <em>please</em> expose the file upload APIs to 3rd-party developers ASAP!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New message notifications even if the app is closed (42%)</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve heard this a lot. I kind of assumed people would just leave an app open if they wanted it still running, but how I use things isn&#8217;t necessarily how others will. One consequence of implementing this will be reduced battery life, so we will need to be careful about it.  Note that Palm recommends not doing background network requests more than 15min per hour. We won&#8217;t exceed that if and when we do implement this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Facebook support</strong><br />
This one kinda surprised me. I only added it as a bit of an afterthought, but I suppose it makes sense, especially since there&#8217;s not a good native Facebook app for the Pre. I actually know very little about the Facebook API and am not super duper excited about building for their walled garden, but if someone wants to build a SpazCore lib for it, we&#8217;ll probably implement something.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also of note were some of the &#8220;Other&#8221; responses. They included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&#8220;More optimized code (use less cpu!)&#8221;<br />
This falls under Faster perf, fo sho.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;tweet with google maps link to current location&#8221;<br />
This is on the list to get implemented</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;hit user pic in timeline to @reply&#8221;<br />
We&#8217;re going to implement something that lets you do actions on a message without going to the detail view. Kinda sucks right now.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;low power consumption&#8221;<br />
The way you do that is to make fewer network requests. This responder will not want background checking, then 8)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;more identica/laconica support&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;d like to see this happen too. If you want it to happen, volunteering to code a Laconica-specific API (or somehow scraping up funding to sponsor development) would help us out a lot. We don&#8217;t have time to do much with non-Twitter APIs right now.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Livejournal support&#8221;<br />
Seems like a microblogging client isn&#8217;t a good match for this, but if we add ping.fm support, you should be able to post to LJ through that. As for reading LJ posts, I think RSS feed support would allow that.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;It needs a non-offensive name before I would purchase it anywhere&#8221;<br />
We had to get one of these, although I&#8217;m surprised we only got one in nearly 150 responses. It&#8217;s not changing. Read the FAQ. Sorry!</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Since last 2 updates it really drains my battery.  LOVE it&#8217;s look and feel though.&#8221;<br />
These are the kinds of things we need to get reported to us. Can&#8217;t fix it if you don&#8217;t report it. Go to <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com">our support site</a> and file an issue, please. Please make sure Spaz is the only culprit involved, though.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Direct blip.fm support (streaming via clicking a link)&#8221;<br />
That would be interesting. If someone&#8217;s willing to look into it dev-wise, I have no issue with it.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Why? When tweed is free. And there&#8217;s more twitter apps to come.&#8221;<br />
No applications are allowed to charge for apps at the moment. That will change in the future, though. I wouldn&#8217;t assume Tweed will remain free, but I have no idea what their plans are.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Copy and paste&#8221;<br />
Talk to Palm, dude. 8)</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Change the name!!!&#8221;<br />
Okay, maybe we got another one, but this didn&#8217;t claim I was making fun of physically or mentally disabled people. Sorry, not changing.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;None&#8221;<br />
This surprised me a little. You could have written &#8220;shits money and cleans my house.&#8221; Surely that would make you more likely to buy it, yes?</p></li>

<p>Spaz on webOS already is usable with any system that has a Twitter-compatible API, including StatusNet. I interpret &#8220;more identica/laconica support&#8221; as meaning support for StatusNet-specific features. The Twitter-compatible API does not expose these features, so a StatusNet-specific library would need to be created.</p>

<p>Would you like to work on this, Philippe?</p>

<p>This is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about and working on for a few weeks now. I wanted to post it here both to understand my motivation, and to hear feedback.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spaz was built for the sake of building it. It is not a means to an end. However, creating it has had several good consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaz demonstrates that making things is good, and sharing how you make them is better.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaz is a necessary counter to closed, hidden technologies. Spaz must always be open.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of Spaz does not lie in the judgements of others, but in the process of building it, and the enjoyment derived by those who use it.</p></li>
<li><p>We welcome anyone who wishes to participate in the Spaz Project with open arms, as long as they understand and respect the purposes of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>The Spaz project values clear and open communication between participants.</p></li>

<div class="photo-credit"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36688133@N00/2894794157/">Photo by Rob Watling</a></div>

<p>In the past two years I&#8217;ve spent most of my free time working on desktop applications written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I write them on top of <strong>web runtime platforms</strong> like <a href="http://titaniumapp.com">Titanium</a> and <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">Adobe AIR</a>, and more recently Palm&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a>. In this time, I&#8217;ve heard a misconception raised repeatedly: that &#8220;local&#8221; (desktop or mobile) applications written on top of web runtimes offer no advantage over remotely-hosted, browser based apps. Or, to paraphrase something I overheard recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HUH huh your app is written in JavaScript and HTML, why don&#8217;t you just load the web site DURRRR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose this kind of thinking comes from the JS+HTML+CSS being almost exclusively used for web site front-ends for so many years. It&#8217;s a knee-jerk reaction, much like the one that says &#8220;oh, you can&#8217;t use PHP in the &#8216;enterprise&#8217;&#8221; or &#8220;Oreos aren&#8217;t for breakfast.&#8221; Proved my mom wrong on that one.</p>

<p>So, I decided to make a list of what things you <em>can</em> do in a web runtime platform that you <em>can&#8217;t</em> do in a browser. Now some of these vary depending on the platform or the browser, and I&#8217;ll try to make note of them in my list:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cross-browser compatibility issues are a thing of the past</strong><br />
I should offer a caveat here &#8212; even though the rendering engines are the same, you&#8217;ll sometimes run into OS rendering differences. AIR, for example, supported CSS3 box shadows on OS X until v1.5, but never did on Windows. But the differences are far, far smaller than you&#8217;d see between, say, Safari 3 and IE6. Trust me &#8212; you will <em>love</em> not having to worry about getting your layout working in some ass-tastic box model implementation anymore</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced rendering features (CSS3, etc)</strong><br />
Since you don&#8217;t have to worry about looking the same in different browsers, you can take advantage of the special features your runtime&#8217;s rendering engine supports. Titanium, for example, supports the same advanced CSS features that Safari 4 does, like <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/box-shadow/">box shadow</a>, <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/">border radius</a>, and <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/css_animations_in_safari/">CSS gradients</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File system access</strong><br />
On desktop web runtime platforms like AIR and Titanium, you can interact with the filesystem just like any other application: read, write, and create files and folders with the permissions of the executing user. webOS offers less freedom in this respect, but you can read and write files on a limited basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Networking</strong><br />
Both of the major desktop web runtime platforms provide much more advanced networking capabilities than are available within a browser. I&#8217;m not much of a networking programmer, but both platforms allow the developer to open TCP socket connections and communicate over them.  Titanium seems especially well-prepared in this area, with its ability to leverage Python and its powerful networking capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No same-origin policy restrictions</strong><br />
If you want to pull data from a web site other than your own in the browser, you have to resort to JSONP &#8212; basically an XSS attack waiting to happen &#8212; or set up a proxy on your site&#8217;s server. Web runtime app platforms don&#8217;t have this issue, so you can make XHR calls to any domain you wish, and interact with any APIs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No need to support non-JS users</strong><br />
This might seem like a small issue, but having to support users who have disabled JS was one of the major reasons I never did serious browser-based frontend programming before I started working on <a href="http://getspaz.com">Spaz</a> two years ago. Now the cool kids at SXSW will tell you that &#8220;nobody&#8221; disables JavaScript, but I think that&#8217;s kind of short-sighted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this argument and the need for graceful degradation and &#8220;unobtrusive&#8221; JavaScript become moot in the web runtime app platform. JavaScript is there, it&#8217;s expected, and you can&#8217;t disable it. So go crazy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using/interacting with platform-specific UI elements</strong><br />
This includes things like window chrome, menu systems, Dock items (OS X), menulings (OS X) and the System tray (Win/Linux). Both major web runtime platforms display your application within the native window chrome, allow you to create native menus, and give you some access to the system tray and OS X&#8217;s Dock. Titanium is a bit better in this regard in that it inherits the native look of form widgets and scrollbars, and provides access to the OS X menubar (those little icons in the top-right).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound playback without plugins</strong><br />
Until HTML5 becomes standard in all browsers and bestows the grace of plugin-less media playback, we&#8217;re stuck <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>ing <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>s in our gorgeously crafted markup. Funk dat. Web runtime platforms provide sound playback APIs that mean we don&#8217;t have to stick a Flash applet in our document and hope it doesn&#8217;t catch the CPU on fire.  AIR has a particularly good playback API (probably because the whole thing is running in a Flash engine. Small victories).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interacting with other applications/shell interaction</strong><br />
Being able to leverage other applications on the machine/device can be really valuable, especially on Unix OSes (Mac OS X, Linux, etc) that have a bevy of useful utilities available from the shell.  Titanium is the only desktop web runtime platform that allows the developer full access to these capabilities; AIR is limited to interacting with other Flash-based applications at this time (although this may change in the future). Runtimes on mobile devices are typically much more limited, although webOS&#8217;s Application Manager service does let applications launch and pass arguments to other apps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database support</strong><br />
Typically this is implemented either via the HTML5-style database stuff (usually asynchronous) or a platform-specific SQLite (usually synchronous). Out of the box, support isn&#8217;t provided for external DB servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL, etc), but with Titanium this should be possible by delegating to Python or Ruby scripts, or Titanium kernel modules. DB servers that provide HTTP interfaces (like <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>) will work fine, though.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of this <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> mean web runtime platforms are going to replace browser-based apps anytime soon.  There are clear advantages to remotely hosting an application (speed of updating comes to mind), and supporting an app on a user&#8217;s machine brings a new group of debugging headaches.  But for applications already chafing at the limitations of the browser, web runtime platforms offer a compelling option.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A great summary of a lot of the points missed by people on this subject.</p>

<p>One thing I think a couple of these points show but is not explicitly said (or I missed it while reading through) is that these applications don&#8217;t need to be online.  They can be created to be offline applications or apps that only need to be online part of the time but still function.  Now with Gears or BrowserPlus you can gain some of this functionality but overall it&#8217;s not as smooth as Air or Titanium (especially for a fully offline application, though I haven&#8217;t written one of those in forever.)</p>

<p>I think this is another strong point for these platforms and why I&#8217;ve been pushing them myself for the projects we have been doing.</p>

<p>Generally, you&#8217;re in a much better situation with Titanium Destkop than AIR.</p>

<p>Titanium supports the Web Worker API. I am not sure about concurrency within the Kroll kernel, which is where the scripting languages execute &#8212; I dunno if the different interpreters all execute in a single thread or not. You can also access and spawn external processes, which you can only do with native-built packages in AIR 2.</p>

<p><a href="http://short.ie/spazchangelog">Spaz 0.5.0</a> went out to the Palm Pre App Catalog today. The coolest new thing is image posting support for <a href="http://www.tweetphoto.com/">TweetPhoto</a>, <a href="http://twitpic.com">Twitpic</a>, <a href="http://yfrog.com">yfrog</a> and <a href="http://Twitgoo.com">Twitgoo</a>. While webOS still doesn&#8217;t have a generic file uploading service that third parties can use, these services support email posting of images, so we were able to build a workable solution using that. It&#8217;s not optimal, and as soon as webOS supports file uploads we&#8217;ll be there with support for even more services, but it works for the time being.</p>

<p>The other major enhancement in 0.5.0 is with notifications. Previously Spaz on webOS had just used &#8220;banner&#8221; notifications when new items were loaded, which appear and disappear quickly on the screen. Lots of users asked for what are called &#8220;dashboard&#8221; notifications in Spaz, though, which are like the ones you get with the email app: an icon is displayed in the corner of the screen, and if you tap it, a larger dashboard appears with more information. These notifications are persistent &#8211;&#160;they won&#8217;t go away until you dismiss them by swiping or tap on them to bring up the Spaz card.</p>

<p>All of these enhancements are available to other webOS developers as well. Because Spaz is open-source with a liberal New BSD-style license, you can use code from <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos/">Spaz</a> or the <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore/">SpazCore</a> libraries in your own apps.  So if you want to do email-based photo posting to Twitter like Spaz does, you can!  And although you are not obligated to tell us, if you do use our code, <a href="spaz@funkatron.com">we&#8217;d love to hear about it</a>.</p>

<p>As always, if you have problems, questions or suggestions, talk to us at our <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com">Tender-driven support site</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/riotcitygirl/273290576/" title="Transparency"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/111/273290576_66eec9db33.jpg" alt="Transparency" title="Transparency" /></a></p>

<p>Folks who got the fancy lad Palm&#174; Pre&#8482; on opening day found the App Catalog chock full of superapps. One of them is Spaz, a ground-up rewrite of the award-winning desktop application I created for the Adobe AIR platform using pure HTML+JavaScript. Getting Spaz on webOS&#8482; has been a big undertaking for me, and the process has certainly had it&#8217;s ups and downs. But I&#8217;m proud of the fact that <strong>we shipped a truly open source, transparent app on the first day of a new platform</strong>.</p>

<p>But much like Spaz on the desktop, this is not a revenue generator for the project. Everyone who works on the Spaz project is a volunteer, and we rely on motivated folks to help us make cool software. It doesn&#8217;t need to be a huge commitment &#8212; even just getting involved in the discussion and coming up with ideas is a big help. But here&#8217;s where we need help the most:</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>While I intend to be the lead on Spaz for webOS&#8482; for a while, I really could use help &#8212; I&#8217;m working in my free time, and that&#8217;s pretty limited with a family and a day job. The full source code of Spaz for webOS&#8482; is <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">available on GitHub</a>, and people who want to help make new features happen are encouraged to check it out.</p>

<p>Even if you&#8217;re not well-versed in webOS&#8482; coding, if you have a good JavaScript background (or don&#8217;t and are just interested in developing one), we need help to build up <a href="http://wiki.github.com/funkatron/spazcore">SpazCore</a>, our component library that drives Spaz for webOS&#8482;, and will drive <em>all</em> our projects in the future. Hacking on SpazCore requires no knowledge of webOS&#8482;.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>We have a brand new, very awesome support site at <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com/">http://spaz.tenderapp.com/</a> which is sponsored by the awesome folks at <a href="http://entp.com/">ENTP</a>. We need to direct people there, and we need to get involved in helping them there. We also should build up the FAQ/Knowledge base. In addition, identifying folks on Twitter who are trying Spaz or having issues and pointing them to the support site is very important.</p>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>

<p>Do you like Spaz? Why? First off, let us know &#8212; I&#8217;d like to build a repository of positive mentions like that. In addition, telling people about Spaz and encouraging them to check it out is great. Hwoever, this needs to be done in a <em>nice</em>, non-abusive, non-spammy way, and we always need to respect other applications and their developers. <strong>THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION</strong> &#8212; it&#8217;s making people aware of quality alternatives to closed, non-transparent software.</p>

<h3>Design/UI</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m an opinionated fellow and rather controlling of how the Spaz apps look, but I also know there are better designers and UX experts than me. If you&#8217;re interested in helping with design and UI work on Spaz &#8212; including additional themes &#8212; I&#8217;d love to hear your ideas.</p>

<h3>What About the Desktop?</h3>

<p>You are not forgotten. Spaz&#8217;s desktop client is long in the tooth, and we have <a href="http://wiki.github.com/funkatron/spazmk2">Big Plans for a full rewrite</a> based on SpazCore. That&#8217;s long-term though, and in the interim work is still being done on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spaz">the current Spaz codebase</a>, including adding multi-account support and improving filtering capabilities. We also intend to transition away from AIR to <a href="http://titaniumapp.com">the Titanium platform</a>.</p>

<p>So if you want to stop bitching in your Twitter account and actually <em>make</em> things better, here&#8217;s your change. <strong>Drop me a line at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;:&#115;&#x70;&#97;&#x7a;&#64;&#x66;u&#110;&#x6b;&#97;&#x74;&#114;&#x6f;n&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#115;&#x70;&#97;&#x7a;&#64;&#x66;u&#110;&#x6b;&#97;&#x74;&#114;&#x6f;n&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a></strong> and we&#8217;ll sort out the best way for you to kick ass.</p>

<p>A few of you may know of a small app I did in AIR a while back called
Searchatron. It&#8217;s mostly a proof of concept, but does have some
usefulness in making it a bit easier to track multiple Twitter search
queries. <a href="http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3">Searchatron</a> uses an MVC-style pattern similar to how the next
version of <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> will be built, and much of Searchatron&#8217;s code provided
the basis for the <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore/">SpazCore</a> component library.</p>

<p>As more of you may know, I&#8217;m very interested in the new <a href="http://Titaniumapp.com">Titanium</a>
platform. It&#8217;s similar to AIR, but fully open-source, and much more
extensible. In order to learn more about Titanium, I tasked myself
last week with converting Searchatron from AIR to Titanium. The whole
process only took a couple hours. You can download the result from
<a href="http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3">http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3</a>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that <a href="http://appcelerant.com">Appcelerator</a>, the creators of the Titanium
platform, are running a contest right now. Two $500 prizes will be
awarded for the most downloaded app, and the highest-rated app,
respectively. If Searchatron wins either of these prizes, I&#8217;m pledging
now to use the prize money to support further development of Spaz and
the SpazCore project, in the form of cash gifts to our most giving
volunteers. It might not be a lot, but it does mean <em>real money</em> is
going to people working on open-source development. I hope to continue
doing so when feasible and prudent.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping, this one is pretty easy: download
Searchatron, and if you like it, suggest others do the same. Feel free
to point them here if you like. By doing so, you&#8217;ll be doing a lot to
encourage the continued development Spaz and its related projects.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t sign <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> with a code signing certificate generated by one of the 4 (as of this writing) certificate authorities Adobe accepts. This means that when you install Spaz, you get a scary &#8220;Publisher:UNVERIFIED&#8221; warning. This is why we don&#8217;t sign, from a letter I wrote when asked about it in Spring 2008:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I sign Spaz with a paid-for Thawte cert, I am on the hook <em>every</em> year for a Thawte cert. I can&#8217;t change my cert signer or go back to a self-signed cert without breaking auto updating (at least as I understand it), and I&#8217;m therefore locked into a $300 expense every year. That&#8217;s not terrible for a commercial app backed by a company, but that&#8217;s a pretty significant chunk of change for a free, open-source app developed by one person as a hobby to lay out.</p>
  
  <p>I&#8217;m familiar with how certs work, and how Thawte handles certification as compared to other, less expensive cert vendors. Were I convinced that Thawte did some kind of verification process/background checking on the applicant I could see the value, but at least with SSL certs, they certainly didn&#8217;t do anything more than vendors who donate free certs to EDUs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, there are 3 other CAs in addition to Thawte, and the prices range between $180 and $300 per year. Some of these CAs do seem to do a little more background checking. Still, the same arguments apply, especially the one related to cost.</p>

<p>Spaz doesn&#8217;t generate revenue, and relies on donated time from myself and a handful of other generous folks. Committing to a yearly expense in the hundreds of dollars seems unwise.</p>

<p>If this is something you would like to see change, I&#8217;d encourage you to <a href="http://adobe.com/go/wish">ask Adobe</a> to make code signing a realistic option for Free, Open-Source Software like Spaz by providing certificates free-of-charge &#8211; after a reasonable review process &#8211; to projects like ours.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything &#8220;sneaky&#8221; about what Adobe is doing.  Adobe isn&#8217;t making any money off of developers purchasing certificates, so we have no incentive to require certs from specific vendors.  As a developer myself, I completely understand not wanting to pay for a certificate, but unfortunately that&#8217;s the direction that the software world has gone in.  Adobe didn&#8217;t invent this; we&#8217;re just adhering to current security standards.</p>

It will take place on Sunday morning at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to be able to lead this conversation, especially because I think security &#8211; especially practical solutions &#8211; is woefully under-represented in social media discussion. It&#8217;s my hope that we can raise awareness of these issues, identify where the biggest problems lie, and start sorting out how to address them.</p>

<p>I am told the Core Conversations will suck less this year. Last year it was often hard to hear people in your group if there was a raucous group next to yours. This year each group should have their own room, which will be a lot better, I think.</p>

<p>Alex &#8220;Bring The&#8221; Payne put an <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/03/03/towards-better-technology-journalism.html">interesting post</a> on <a href="http://al3x.net/">his blog</a> yesterday about improving the state of tech journalism.  While I tend to feel that what he describes is not unique to IT, I don&#8217;t think that this means we should just say &#8220;oh well, it sucks.&#8221; Bad things will always be around, but I&#8217;d rather work towards making less of it, even if just in my own little circle of dorks.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s a complex issue that likely needs to be addressed in several ways, one aspect that stuck in my head is <em>incentive</em>. Alex talks about this generally as one of a few possible solutions to this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Incentivize technology reporting as a career</strong> &#8212; It&#8217;s hard to make a buck as a technology journalist, particularly one who reports on something more substantial than gadgets and empty enterprise software press releases. No wonder that TechCrunch has gone the route of sensationalism; it drives ad clicks and sparks debate, making a potentially dreary beat profitable and exciting. Tech journalism isn&#8217;t sexy, but it could be made so. That change starts with breaking the cycle of low-quality tech reporting, giving prospective technology journalists a set of role models they can aspire to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that at least in part, this comes down to (as so many things do) money: how much tech writers are paid.  I also believe that we aren&#8217;t doing right by the folks who strive for excellence in tech journalism, making their jobs harder than they should be.</p>

<p>I frequently hear people talk about how teachers are underpaid; how those who have such an impact on our lives at an early age should be well-paid, because that will attract higher-quality candidates. I tend to agree with this idea, at very least in the sense that if you are paying more, you will tend to get better people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done freelance writing off and on since I was a teenager, and I&#8217;ve been doing &#8220;development&#8221; in one way or another in computers for almost as long. One thing I can tell you with certainty is that it is far, far easier to make money <em>doing</em> IT stuff than writing about it.  Tech writing simply doesn&#8217;t pay well in almost all cases.  Every time I&#8217;ve written an article or worked on a book<sup id="fnref:book"><a href="#fn:book" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the money was <em>not</em> the primary factor, because I was barely making minimum wage (or worse) if I actually did the math<sup id="fnref:math"><a href="#fn:math" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Getting people who do know their stuff to write about IT is made significantly more challenging, because it means sacrificing productive, profitable opportunities. It can mean the difference between handling your mortgage payment with no problem, and asking your landlord for a couple extra days to get the rent money.</p>

<p>As consumers in the economy, we vote with our dollars. When we purchase a product, we enable the companies involved in creating that product to keep doing business as they see fit. We effectively endorse their actions (intentionally or not) in this way.</p>

<p>For &#8220;free&#8221; product like most web sites, though, we don&#8217;t vote with our dollars &#8211;&#160;we vote with our eyeballs. Ad revenue is determined by visits. Ad revenue is what keeps most journalistic<sup id="fnref:journalistic"><a href="#fn:journalistic" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> sites in business. When we visit a site, we are enabling them to do business as they see fit. We are endorsing their actions.</p>

<p>Ad blocking software complicates the issue, especially on tech news sites, where the relatively savvy readership blocks ads at a much higher rate<sup id="fnref:rate"><a href="#fn:rate" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. It&#8217;s sort of a passive-aggressive way of dealing with something we don&#8217;t like: still playing the game, but fudging the rules. Unfortunately, I suspect this only leads to two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>more ads (and more intrusive/obnoxious ads) to make up for the loss</li>
<li>questionable and nefarious practices to make up for the loss</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously some folks are going to do lame stuff no matter what, and the use of ad blocking software won&#8217;t impact their behavior.  But for people who want to do The Right Thing, this makes things harder.  Harder for them to pay people to write.  Harder for writers to support themselves and their families.  Ad revenue is, in the vast majority of cases, the only viable revenue stream these sites have.  By blocking ads, we use their service, but take away their ability to pay for it.</p>

<p>There are security concerns associated with some ads, of course, and sometimes we can&#8217;t anticipate what kinds of ads we might see on a new site. In these cases, I would suggest a couple potential approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a technology blocker like Flashblock to allow you to selectively enable Flash applets only on trusted sites</li>
<li>use an adblocker defensively at first, but enable ads on sites you trust</li>
</ul>

<p>If you like the way a tech news site does business, vote with your eyeballs and turn off your ad blockers. If, however, you don&#8217;t like how they do business &#8211; or if they run obnoxious or potentially dangerous ads &#8211; follow the same principle and <em>don&#8217;t visit the site</em>. <em>At all</em>.  That will be far more effective than simply blocking ads.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a good piece from The Week titled <a href="http://www.theweek.com/article/index/93866/Is_writing_for_the_rich">&#8220;Is Writing for the Rich?&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s not obvious how young writers without accommodating, well-to-do parents or a trust from gramps make it these days. Surely they can&#8217;t spend a year or two blogging without pay until an audience evolves to nurture them. They&#8217;ll starve. Meantime, freelance rates for non-fluff magazine writing have barely risen in the past 15 years. And the chances of getting a job at a quality newspaper or a serious magazine are fast approaching zero.</p>

If a website is willing to make it&#8217;s content freely available to me, and instead support itself through ads, I&#8217;m fine with that. If I find the ads annoying or obtrusive I weight that against the perceived worth of the content. That&#8217;s &#8220;the deal&#8221;, you give me free content, I view your ads.</p>

<p>Some sites make the deal more obvious, Salon.com formally used large interstitial ads, or required going off site and viewing a 30 second spot, then returning for the premium content. Slashdot.org also offers the ability to pay them money to not see ads, a deal I&#8217;ve taken them up on in the past.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on a site now, and I will likely actively degrade the experiance for users viewing the sites with an ad blocker enabled.</p>

Working on the Web, I frequently have to turn off anything fancy to see things &#8220;through the eyes of others&#8221;, browsing with IE or with JavaScript disabled, etc. Running adblockers and having to enable/disable them all the time is one more thing I&#8217;d rather not deal with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also found that over the years I&#8217;m simply better able to tune out ads I find offensive or uninteresting, across all media. My mind has a mute button built in, and there&#8217;s really no need for software to supplement it. Occasionally an interesting tidbit will creep in via banner ad or some such, and I&#8217;m glad to have not missed them.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re absolutely right: <strong>If they run obnoxious ads, don&#8217;t visit the site!</strong></p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past, I&#8217;m currently working on a new project that&#8217;s been taking my time away from <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>. While most details are still under wraps, I can say now that the new project is a version of Spaz for mobile devices. Rather than a port, this is a whole new codebase that takes advantage of all the stuff I&#8217;ve learned writing Spaz for AIR.</p>

<p>While I will still be working hard on the mobile app for at least another month, I have been thinking a lot about where the desktop app should be going. Here&#8217;s the plan:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Version 0.8 will be the last version of Spaz using the current codebase. We are currently being held back by the design decisions I made, and they need to be tossed. Versions 0.9 and later will be based on a complete rewrite of the codebase. It will use an MVC-style pattern, and will be powered by the SpazCore component library. SpazCore being worked on now, and is hosted on GitHub at <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore/">http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I may switch from the AIR platform to Titanium for the new Spaz codebase. I am still weighing this decision, but I&#8217;m very interested in TI, especially after having the opportunity to meet the development team last week. They have a very strong platform, and their approach is very much in line with the &#8220;Spaz philosophy.&#8221; <a href="http://titaniumapp.com">http://titaniumapp.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Feature-wise, I&#8217;m targeting all<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> existing features, plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple instances of the &#8220;main&#8221; windows (basically the current Spaz window, multiple times for multiple accounts)</li>
<li>multiple search windows with auto-updating results</li>
<li>less reliance on the web site for user and message details</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Spaz should still be very suitable for average Twitter users (under 100 friends), but will also offer powerful search features for folks who need them. And of course, Spaz will still be completely open-source under a New BSD-style license.</p>

<p>Questions? Comments? Post them in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/spaz-users/browse_thread/thread/51cdd1accb94b6a2">the Google Groups thread</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Actually, one feature of Spaz that may see a reduction in functionality is theming. Supporting multiple themes in the main release is an <em>enormous</em> pain whenever I need to make an interface change. While I expect it will still be possible to override most or all of the interface with CSS, I will likely shoot for a single good theme to ship with Spaz, and leave modifications as an exercise for the motivated user.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>That said, I LOVE how whitespace looks on the current version.</p>

<p><em>Reposting something you wrote is a lot easier than coming up with original content. This article was <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2008/json-is-everybodys-friend-by-ed-finkler">originally posted</a> as part of the <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2008/">2008 PHP Advent Calendar</a></em></p>

<p>Last year I wrote some kind of feel-good, hippie crap for the PHP Advent
Calendar. This year I got a haircut, took a shower, and am ready to tell you
about something practical: working with <a href="http://json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
in PHP.</p>

<p>&#8220;JSON?!&#8221; you cry. &#8220;But that&#8217;s for JavaScript fruitcakes!&#8221; And you&#8217;d be right.
But JSON, while valid JavaScript code, is actually a very effective serialized
data format for exchanging data between applications written in a variety of
languages. And as of PHP 5.2, we have <a href="http://php.net/json"><em>native</em> support for JSON encoding and
decoding</a>.</p>

<h3>But I Love XML!</h3>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t? The thing is, for moving data around&#8212;not documents, but data&#8212;I
think JSON is superior to XML. This is mainly because JSON tends to map better
to the data models in most programming languages&#8212;arrays, objects, etc. JSON
<em>is</em> serialized JavaScript, so it&#8217;s easy peasy representing these kinds of
things. Moving between JSON and your language&#8217;s internal data models is
usually just a single function call. Smarter people than me can debate the
pros and cons of XML and JSON in various scenarios, but for a lot of what I
do, JSON does the same thing and requires less work.</p>

<h3>Get Your PHP Objects On</h3>

<p>In PHP 5.2+, there are two functions that handle JSON: <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php"><code>json_encode()</code></a>,
which takes a PHP data structure and returns a JSON string, and
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php"><code>json_decode()</code></a>, which takes a JSON string and converts it into a PHP
data structure. Let&#8217;s take a look at <code>json_encode()</code> and how it handles
converting a PHP object into JSON:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
// make a simple object
$obj-&gt;body           = 'another post';
$obj-&gt;id             = 21;
$obj-&gt;approved       = true;
$obj-&gt;favorite_count = 1;
$obj-&gt;status         = NULL;

// convert into JSON
$json_obj = json_encode($obj);
echo $json_obj;
</code></pre>

<p>This will output the following JSON string:</p>

<pre><code>{"body":"another post","id":21,"approved":true,"favorite_count":1,"status":null}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s take that JSON and turn it back into PHP:</p>

<pre><code>// convert back into PHP
$new_obj = json_decode($json_obj);
var_dump($new_obj);
</code></pre>

<p>And we&#8217;ll have the following PHP object:</p>

<pre><code>object(stdClass)#2 (5) {
  ["body"]=&gt;
  string(12) "another post"
  ["id"]=&gt;
  int(21)
  ["approved"]=&gt;
  bool(true)
  ["favorite_count"]=&gt;
  int(1)
  ["status"]=&gt;
  NULL
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the data types are retained in the process. JSON supports strings,
numbers, objects, arrays (kinda), booleans and <code>NULL</code>. Things like methods,
constants, and non-public properties are dropped in the encoding process, as
shown in the example below:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
class Foo {
  const     ERROR_CODE = '404';
  public    $public_ex = 'this is public';
  private   $private_ex = 'this is private!';
  protected $protected_ex = 'this should be protected';

  public function getErrorCode() {
    return self::ERROR_CODE;
  }
}

$foo = new Foo
$foo_json = json_encode($foo
echo $foo_json
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs the following JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{"public_ex":"this is public"}
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that when you decode JSON into a PHP object, the object type is
always <code>stdClass</code>. If we use <code>$foo_json</code> from above&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>$foo_new = json_decode($foo_json);
var_dump($foo_new);
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230;we&#8217;ll get back the following object:</p>

<pre><code>object(stdClass)#4 (1) {
 ["public_ex"]=&gt;
 string(14) "this is public"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Arrays, Indexed &amp; Associative</h3>

<p>Array support in JSON is limited to <em>indexed</em> arrays&#8212;those with sequential,
numeric keys. Associative arrays are converted into an object with
corresponding properties.</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
// here's an indexed array. JSON natively handles these
$arr = array('orange', 'yellow', 'green', 122);
$json_arr = json_encode($arr);
echo $json_arr."\n";
</code></pre>

<p>That gives us this JSON:</p>

<pre><code>["orange","yellow","green",122]
</code></pre>

<p>And we can convert it back into PHP&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>$new_arr = json_decode($json_arr);
var_dump($new_arr);
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230;without losing anything in the process.</p>

<pre><code>array(4) {
  [0]=&gt;
  string(6) "orange"
  [1]=&gt;
  string(6) "yellow"
  [2]=&gt;
  string(5) "green"
  [3]=&gt;
  int(122)
}
</code></pre>

<p>With associative arrays, the array is converted to an object. Also note that
all associative keys are converted into strings in the process:</p>

<pre><code>// associative PHP arrays are converted into objects
$assoc = array('orange'=&gt;'yellow', 'green'=&gt;122, 9=&gt;122);
$json_assoc = json_encode($assoc);
</code></pre>

<p>The encoded JSON will be <code>{"orange":"yellow","green":122,"9":122}</code>. Decoding
<em>that</em> gives us this PHP object:</p>

<pre><code>object(stdClass)#5 (3) {
  ["orange"]=&gt;
  string(6) "yellow"
  ["green"]=&gt;
  int(122)
  ["9"]=&gt;
  int(122)
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can, however, convert the JSON object back into a PHP associative array by passing <code>TRUE</code> as the second param to <code>json_decode()</code> (thanks Richard Orelup).</p>

<h3>Playing Well with Others</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s all fine and good, but it might help to actually do something useful
with all this encodin&#8217; and decodin&#8217;. JSON is a really good choice for moving
data between client-side JavaScript applications and server-side applications,
because JSON <em>is</em> JavaScript code, and maps perfectly onto JavaScript&#8217;s data
structures.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s contrive a simple application that passes a &#8220;counter&#8221; object back
and forth between the client and server. The counter object stores information
on how often the PHP server application and the JavaScript client application
&#8220;touch&#8221; it. First, we&#8217;ll make a PHP script to serve up some JSON code to our
JavaScript client. It will look for an <code>action</code> parameter in <code>$_GET</code>, perform
the requested action, and serve up some JSON in return.</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
if ($_GET['action'] === "getinit") {

  // make the PHP object and add a PHP touch
  $counter-&gt;php_touches    = 1;
  $counter-&gt;js_touches    = 0;
  send_as_json($counter);

} elseif ($_GET['action'] === "updatedata") {
  // decode JSON
  $counter = json_decode($_POST['counter']);

  // increment php touch counter
  $counter-&gt;php_touches++;

  // serve up as JSON
  send_as_json($counter);

} else {
  send_as_json(false);
}


function send_as_json($obj) {

  // convert object to JSON
  $json = json_encode($obj);

  // set appropriate headers
  header('Content-Type: application/json');

  // output JSON string as body
  echo $json;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>getinit</code> action will create a <code>$counter</code> object, initialize it with a
couple of variables to track &#8220;touches&#8221; by PHP and JSON, and serve up the
object as JSON via the <code>send_as_json()</code> function. The <code>updatedata</code> action will
take JSON from the <code>$_POST</code> array, decode it into the <code>$counter</code> object,
increment the <code>php_touches</code> property, and serve up the modified object as
JSON.</p>

<p>In the <code>send_as_json()</code> function, note the <code>header()</code> call that sets the
<code>Content-Type</code> to <code>application/json</code>. Setting the content type correctly is
good practice, and will sometimes avoid <a href="http://jibbering.com/blog/?p=514">unexpected security issues</a>.</p>

<p>On the client side, we&#8217;ll make a short HTML page with some embedded JavaScript
to interact with our PHP service.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Rendered in the browser, the page will look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://funkatron.com/content/jsonphp.html-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Note that we&#8217;re using the jQuery library (loaded from the Google JavaScript
Libraries API) to handle DOM manipulation and Ajax calls. We&#8217;re also using the
JSON2.js parser, available at <a href="http://json.org/json2.js">JSON.org</a>, to safely parse and create JSON.
The default method for decoding JSON into a JavaScript object or array is
<code>eval()</code>, but that leaves us open to <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/safely-parsing-json-in-javascript/">all sorts of code injection issues</a>.</p>

<p>Jumping into our JavaScript code, the <code>$().ready()</code> is the most interesting
portion. The <code>ready()</code> method called on <code>$(document)</code> takes the anonymous
function passed into it, and executes the function as soon as the document is
&#8220;ready&#8221;&#8212;that is, when the DOM is completed and can be safely messed with. So,
when the DOM is ready, two things will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <code>GET</code> request is made to <code>jsonphp.php?action=getinit</code>, and the results
are passed as text to the <code>processData()</code> function</p></li>
<li><p>An event listener is assigned to the click event for the button with the
<code>id</code> of <code>increment-button</code>. This listener will fire a function that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Grabs the values for the touch counts out of the form fields</p></li>
<li><p>Assigns them to the <code>counter</code> object</p></li>
<li><p>Encodes the <code>counter</code> object as JSON</p></li>
<li><p><code>POST</code>s <code>counter</code> to the server</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>So, each time we click the &#8220;Increment!&#8221; button, the object is sent from the
JavaScript application to the PHP application as JSON. Each side will
increment its own counter in the object, and the JavaScript application will
display those values to us in the page. If we want, we can even change the
values, and the JavaScript application will bind the new values to the object
before sending it to the server.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s It All Mean, Dave?</h3>

<p>Metaphysically, I have no idea. But practically, JSON support in PHP means
that our favorite server-side language is an even <em>better</em> glue language&#8212;
something it&#8217;s been good at for a long time. Now, go forth and make the next
mega-ajax-crowdsourced-mashup masterpiece.</p>

<p>I used Firebug to try and work out what was happening and I could see that although the data was being sent as &#123;&#8221;php_touches&#8221;:1,&#8221;js_touches&#8221;:1&#125; the PHP script was sending back only &#123;&#8221;php_touches&#8221;:1&#125; so it looks like the js_touch part of the posted JSON data isn&#8217;t being decoded properly.</p>

<p>The coming weeks are gonna be a little hectic for me, as I fly to Atlanta on the 12th to attend <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/">php|works / PyWorks 2008</a>. I&#8217;ll be doing the following talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s3/1">Building Desktop RIAs with PHP, HTML and Javascript in AIR</a></li>
<li><a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s7/1">The CodeIgniter Framework</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited about <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/">php|works / PyWorks 2008</a>, especially because we can interact with the Python community and learn more about each other&#8217;s tech. Cross-pollination is a Good Thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m flying back to IND on the 15th, but then I&#8217;m leaving again on the 16th for San Francisco and the <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na">Adobe MAX 2008 conference</a>. I&#8217;m giving the following talk:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#754">Developing Rich Applications with jQuery and Adobe AIR</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Originally this talk was going to be given by <a href="http://ejohn.org">John Resig</a>, creator of the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> library, but he ran into some time constraints and thoughtfully suggested me. Of course, the description still mentions his name, which likely means I&#8217;ll be tarred and feathered by the audience. This also looks like it may be the largest audience I&#8217;ve ever given a talk before: there are currently about 70 folks listed as attending, with ~300 capacity. So if I wet myself on stage, please forgive me.</p>

<p>I love me some <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a>. It saves me tons of parsing headaches when exchanging data between web services because it maps so well to concepts shared among most common programming languages. It&#8217;s super easy to take a PHP object, convert it to JSON, and then push it to a Javascript (or a Ruby, or a Python) app.</p>

<p>Because JSON is valid JavaScript code, the most common method for converting it into native JS objects is to just <code>eval</code> the JSON. This is an extremely bad idea, because it opens your app up to all sorts of code injection attacks. Even with &#8220;trusted&#8221; sources, a security failure on your source&#8217;s end, or just a disgruntled employee, could wreak havoc on your apps and your users. I&#8217;d recommend reading <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/04/10/json-and-browser-security/">Douglas Crockford&#8217;s &#8220;JSON and Browser Security&#8221;</a>. Go ahead; I&#8217;ll wait. <img src="http://funkatron.com/content/rockanim.gif" alt="Rockford is impatient" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, which we&#8217;ll use for all our examples because it&#8217;s awesome, will in many cases automatically parse JSON responses for you. This, as we learned above, is a Bad Thing. The following <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax">Ajax methods</a> will automatically parse JSON in jQ (as of 1.2):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>jQuery.getJSON()</code> &#8211; <em>always</em></li>
<li><code>jQuery.ajax()</code> &#8211; <em>if <code>type</code> is &#8216;json&#8217;</em></li>
<li><code>jQuery.get()</code> &#8211; <em>if <code>type</code> is &#8216;json&#8217;</em></li>
<li><code>jQuery.post()</code> &#8211; <em>if <code>type</code> is &#8216;json&#8217;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So my rules of thumbs are:</p>

<ol>
<li>never, ever use <code>$.getJSON()</code></li>
<li>never, ever set the <code>type</code> option to &#8216;json.&#8217;</li>
</ol>

<p>To force the issue, I set my type to &#8216;text&#8217; in my ajax calls. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="/js/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
    $.ajax('http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.json', function(data, textStatus) {
        alert('Status is '+textStatus);
        alert('JSON data string is: '+data);
    }, 'text');     
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, we&#8217;re including the jquery library with the first <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, and then calling the <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> method in the second. We&#8217;re passing three parameters:</p>

<ol>
<li>the URL we&#8217;re pulling the JSON string from. In this case, it&#8217;s the Twitter public timeline</li>
<li>an anonymous function that&#8217;s called when the request is successful</li>
<li>the type of data we&#8217;re getting, as a string. Using &#8216;text&#8217; ensures no extra processing is done on the response string</li>
</ol>

<p>So this is great, but all we&#8217;ve got is a string of serialized data, which isn&#8217;t terribly useful. Thankfully, there&#8217;s <a href="http://json.org/json2.js">a handy library</a> at <a href="http://json.org">JSON.org</a> that takes care of parsing JSON <strike>without using <code>eval</code></strike> without using <code>eval</code> on non-JSON code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The library gives us two methods: <code>JSON.parse()</code> for turning a JSON string into a JS object, and <code>JSON.stringify()</code> for turning a JS object into a JSON string. So let&#8217;s utilize JSON.parse() in our code, and actually do something with that data:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="/js/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="/js/JSON2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
    $.get('http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.json', function(data, textStatus) {
        alert('Status is '+textStatus);
        alert('JSON data string is: '+data);

        // this will give us an array of objects
        var public_tweets = JSON.parse(data);

        // iterate over public_tweets
        for(var x=0; x &lt; public_tweets.length; x++) {
            var twt = public_tweets[x];
            var elm = '&lt;div class="tweet" id="'+twt.id+'"&gt; \
                &lt;a href="'+twt.user.url+'"&gt;&lt;img src="'+twt.user.profile_image_url+'" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \
                    &lt;div class="tweet-text"&gt;'+twt.text+'&lt;/div&gt; \
                &lt;/div&gt;';
            $('BODY').prepend(elm);
        }
    }, 'text');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the modified example above, the second script tag loads the JSON2 library. We then use the <code>JSON.parse()</code> method to turn the data string into a JavaScript object &#8211; in this case, and array of Twitter message objects. Then we iterate over the array, building a string of HTML for each entry and prepending it to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag (so the newest item is on top).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#8217;re using this code on a remotely-hosted html page (or loading it as a local file under Firefox 3), it won&#8217;t work, and if you check in your error console you&#8217;ll probably see a security warning. That&#8217;s because our <code>$.get()</code> call directly accesses the Twitter API hosted on Twitter.com, which is almost certainly not the domain your files are hosted on. When we try to do so, it violates the same-origin policy enforced by browsers. The only workaround that I think is safe is to set up some sort of proxy on <em>your</em> domain to pass requests &#8211; other approaches like JSONP rely on <code>eval()</code>ing the result, which is what we&#8217;re trying to avoid here. I&#8217;ll try to cover setting up a local domain proxy in a future post.</p>

<p>By handling JSON with a parser rather than just using <code>eval()</code>, we mitigate the risk of code injection. This helps us protect both our application <em>and</em> our users.</p>

<p>Most libraries do this now, including MooTools, whose Request.JSON has a &#8220;secure&#8221; option. This can be disabled if you reeeeally think you can trust someone, but is on by default and applies same or similar checks on returned data as json2.js.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can use the flXHRproxy jQuery plugin which adapts flXHR for use with jQuery&#8217;s various Ajax methods. flXHR is a completely API compatible replacement for native XHR but allows cross-domain Ajax. It does so by using an invisible flash file to bridge the domains (if the target server authorizes such with a simple policy file).</p>

<p><a href="http://flxhr.flensed.com/jquery.php">flXHRproxy jQuery plugin</a></p>

<p>The key is that flXHR wraps the invisible flash file in smart Javascript that exactly mimics the XHR API so that flXHR acts a drop-in replacement, so the flXHRproxy jQuery plugin simply registers flXHR as the alternate XHR object and the rest of the Ajax mechanisms work as normal without being any the wiser.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been developing with AIR for over a year now. It&#8217;s all been HTML/JavaScript apps, but the complexity of most of them has been pretty low. <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz, the Twitter client I created</a>, definitely isn&#8217;t simple, though &#8211; mostly because I&#8217;m kind of a crappy coder, but also because it just does a <em>lot</em> of stuff.</p>

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been getting a little bummed about AIR, because I&#8217;m starting to bump into limitations of the platform more and more. What&#8217;s particularly frustrating is that some of these limitations are specific to HTML AIR app dev. So what follows is a couple of issues that have been particularly troublesome when developing Spaz and other HTML/JS AIR apps.</p>

<h3>AIR gets greedy under OS X</h3>

<p>Julien Viet, who has contributed significantly to <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, made <a href="http://blog.julienviet.com/2008/08/21/air-ajax-runtime-footprint/">a post recently about the base resources used by the AIR runtime</a>. In it he finds that the basic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; sample app provided by Adobe used about 20MB of RAM, and hovered at about 2% CPU usage even when idling. I replicated these tests on my Macbook (2.2Ghz, 4GB) under OS X 10.5.4 and WinXP SP2, and had similar results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkatron/2786328117/" title="AIR HTML app - Base CPU and memory usage (WinXP SP2) by funkatron, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2786328117_1e05b1fc9c_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="AIR HTML app - Base CPU and memory usage (WinXP SP2)" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkatron/2786274247/" title="AIR HTML app - Base CPU and memory usage by funkatron, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/2786274247_8d861eba94_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="AIR HTML app - Base CPU and memory usage" /></a></p>

<p>I also created <a href="http://funkatron.com/content/HelloWorld-Flex-AIR.zip" title="Zip archive">a Flex-based &#8220;Hello World&#8221; application</a> to compare base usage if the Webkit renderer isn&#8217;t being used. Memory usage was slightly lower, but otherwise it was comparable to the HTML app.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkatron/2786341667/" title="AIR Flex app - Base CPU and memory usage (WinXP) by funkatron, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2786341667_76e8da9cee_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="AIR Flex app - Base CPU and memory usage (WinXP)" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkatron/2786295423/" title="AIR Flex app - Base CPU and memory usage by funkatron, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3149/2786295423_46092b58c9_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="AIR Flex app - Base CPU and memory usage" /></a></p>

<p>The constant CPU usage seems to be specific to OS X: WinXP will jump back and forth between 0% and 2%. This is consistent with my observations of CPU usage in Spaz as well: in OS X, we get 10-15% CPU usage constantly, but under XP and Vista, CPU usage is 0% while idling.  Initial memory usage is also about 30% higher with Spaz under OS X than it is under Windows. Something is goofy with AIR on OS X.</p>

<p>That aside, I don&#8217;t think the memory and CPU usage of AIR are surprising, considering the technology. AIR is a full Flash runtime, and HTML apps add a Webkit renderer on top of that. The memory and CPU usage is in line &#8212; or a bit lower &#8212; than most <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">SSBs</a>. Using traditional browser tech to build a desktop app is going to be a tradeoff in terms of memory and CPU usage, just like many other technologies that make development easier.  But for one reason or another, the expectation seems to be that AIR is a lightweight technology, and it&#8217;s really not.</p>

<h3>AIR HTML apps are leaky</h3>

<p>What is particularly problematic is that there seem to be memory leaks within the Webkit engine as used in AIR &#8211; or at very least, it&#8217;s pretty easy to leak memory. Apps like Spaz run into this problem because it&#8217;s constantly pulling in large amounts of new data and images, and is often left running for hours or days on end.</p>

<p>Some of this is almost certainly because you can get away with that kind of thing on a web site, where users are unlikely to leave a single page open for days on end. Even if a web site does causes a big leakage, the browser almost always gets blamed. The libraries and tools available for HTML/JS devs, being browser-focused, typically don&#8217;t pay much attention to long-term performance issues.</p>

<h3>Essential tools, like profilers and step debuggers, are non-existent</h3>

<p>But memory leaks are a problem for most desktop app developers. That&#8217;s why memory profiling tools are common in desktop frameworks. And Adobe certainly understands this to be the case with Flex, as it&#8217;s FlexBuilder 3 IDE ships with memory and peformance profiling tools, as well as a full-featured debugger with breakpoints et al. That&#8217;s perfect if I was writing something in Flex, but <strong>it is completely useless for HTML/JavaScript AIR apps</strong>.  I was able to get Spaz to run from within Flex Builder with <a href="http://www.stratulat.com/blog/use-flex-builder-3-to-create-a-javascript-air-application" title="Use Flex Builder 3 to create a JavaScript AIR application">a tiny bit of hackery</a>, but the profiler gets no information about what&#8217;s going on within Webkit.</p>

<p>Other common choices for debugging web apps aren&#8217;t available either: Firebug is Mozilla-specifc, and the <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/Drosera">Drosera</a> debugger and Web Inspector tools can&#8217;t hook into AIR&#8217;s Webkit instances.  The information on Drosera does say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In WebKit there is a WebScriptDebugServer which is started when WebKit starts and listens for a DCOM connection. Once a connection is made it will begin to interact with Drosera via Drosera&#8217;s ServerConnection class. WebScriptDebugServer informs Drosera about every line of JavaScript executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would assume that WebScriptDebugServer exists inside AIR&#8217;s Webkit, but AFAIK this has not been utilized in any way.  Adobe does have a nice AIR-specific tool called the AIR Introspector in the SDK, and it does offer some very useful functionality, but it too lacks step debugging and profiling capabilities.</p>

<p>That leaves us with good old console logging as our <em>only</em> option for debugging AIR HTML apps.  That&#8217;s okay for simpler stuff, but tracking down execution bugs in more complex applications becomes extremely tedious. And console logging is basically useless for memory profiling, as there&#8217;s no insight into the underlying operations of Webkit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud of the work I&#8217;ve done on Spaz, but as the application has grown in complexity, I&#8217;ve found the limitations of HTML app dev in AIR more and more problematic. Adobe has consistently stated that the HTML dev side of AIR is as important as the Flash/Flex side. To quote Mike Chambers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adobe AIR is as much about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc&#8230; as it is about Flash / Flex. <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2007/10/25/mozilla-prism-and-the-disingenuous-web/#comment-9529">#</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that truly is the case, Adobe needs to commit to providing a toolset for HTML/JS developers comparable to what Flex developers have.  Until that&#8217;s changes, Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/En/XULRunner">XULRunner</a> and <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Prism">Prism</a> platforms are looking more and more appealing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Before you start with xulrunner: debugging it is very painful as well. We used it for a large-ish project with lots of forms (business logic) in 2007, but the following post from 2004 is still valid in many points: http://www.jerf.org/resources/xblinjs/whyNotMozilla/index.html</p>

<p>The first few week were bliss, xulrunner certainly allows you to prototype quickly.</p>

<p>The following two month we hit so many walls that we re-did the gui in pygtk.</p>

<p>thanks for sharing. I can confirm many of the issues with Flex. Although there is a profiler, it is not easy to solve memory leaks, especially because you have no control over Garbage Collection.
Let&#8217;s hope next releases of the framework will allow a lower level management of memory allocation/release.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@tom: thanks for the feedback there. I think my approach might be a bit different in that I&#8217;d be placing most of the app inside an HTML renderer widget. That was I can still write in HTML and JS, and I should be able to use debugging tools like Firebug with a little muckery. I am interested in looking at pygtk, though.</p>

<p>@funkyboy: I thought there was <em>some</em> (not a lot) of control over GC via the system.gc() call:
http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/air/1/aslr/flash/system/System.html#gc()
Still, that&#8217;s not the same as easily discovering mem leaks. I think pushing Adobe for this kind of debugging is a good idea.</p>

<p>Remember when you went to <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSWi</a> <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/">last year</a>, and you said &#8220;I love the parts where I meet cool people and eat free food and drink free booze and throw up, but I wish the presentations and panels weren&#8217;t so goddamn fluffy?&#8221; Me too. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne</a> (aka &#8220;The Guy Who Has Actual Name Recognition&#8221;) and myself submitted the talk &#8220;<strong><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2065?return=/ideas/index/3/q:security">Security for the Social Set</a></strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea is that we give some solid, useful information about the security problems social networking apps have to deal with, and how to deal with them. While we can&#8217;t get too focused on specific languages and frameworks, client-side defense with JavaScript will certainly be demonstrated, and I intend to show examples in PHP and probably a couple other platforms (<em>cough</em>Rails<em>cough</em>). It will be hard to get into heavy detail within the alloted time, but it&#8217;s my hope that we can kickstart awareness and understanding of fundamental secure web app programming techniques.</p>

<p>Plus, I need a justification for dropping the coin for hotel and air fare on this boozefest, so please, <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2065?return=/ideas/index/3/q:security">vote for us</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been many months since I&#8217;ve posted about <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> here, but I&#8217;ve actually still been working on it quite a bit. Spaz recently had its 1 year anniversary, which is a pretty good milestone for one of my projects &#8211;&#160;I usually lose interest well before this. Not only is Spaz one of the oldest <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> desktop clients still under development, but it&#8217;s also one of the few FOSS clients.  I also believe Spaz is one of the most sophisticated <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/develop/ajax/">AIR HTML</a> apps out there, and is a good example of what can be done with HTML and JavaScript on the desktop.</p>

<p>The newest release of Spaz, which came out a couple days ago, adds some significant new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Image uploading via <a href="http://twitpic.com/" title="Twitpic.com">Twitpic.com</a></li>
<li>Crossposting support via <a href="http://ping.fm">Ping.fm</a>. Try beta code &#8220;vivalaping&#8221;</li>
<li>Support for microblogging services with Twitter-compatible APIs, including <a href="http://Identi.ca">Identi.ca</a></li>
<li>A Dock icon badge with the unread message count. This is probably less significant if you are not running OS X.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/spaz/AIR/whatsnew.html">the whole fat list of what&#8217;s new</a>. Also, if you want to talk to other users or <strong>help with development</strong>, here are some resources:</p>

<p>I have these five promo codes from Dreamhost. They expire in three days. Apparently you get super-hot deals with them, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Four times the normal disk and bandwidth</li>
<li>$150 off a 5-year plan</li>
<li>$200 off a 10-year plan</li>
</ul>

<p>I would not sign up for 5 years with any shared host. However, I do think DH is pretty decent for small-ish sites that can work with shared hosting. I&#8217;m well aware that they&#8217;ve had a couple embarrassing public flubs in the past couple years, but I generally think they&#8217;re good folks who try to do right by their customers. Some will certainly disagree, of course. 8)</p>

<p>I still maintain my old account there for low-cpu, high-bandwidth/storage stuff. They do quite well with PHP hosting, and can handle Ruby and Python setups with a little effort. They&#8217;ll let you do crazy stuff like compile your own PHP if you are fine with using FastCGI, and have a nice GUI to setup SVN repos. Not many shared hosts will do the same at a similar price point.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the codes. They&#8217;re first come, first serve. Yes, I make money if you sign up with one of them. I will not be hurt if you don&#8217;t use them.</p>

<ul>
<li>998942362256</li>
<li>916860787004</li>
<li>591140700044</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working at <a href="http://purdue.edu">Purdue</a> for over 6 years now, and I have to say that I&#8217;ve enjoyed it immensely. While the experience can vary from department to department, in general it&#8217;s a fairly low-pressure environment with a lot of opportunities to learn and develop new skills for motivated folks. Purdue offers great benefits, and the Greater Lafayette area is a pretty cool, decently progressive environment considering the size &#8211; US News &amp; World Report recently picked West Lafayette one of <a href="http://www.usnews.com/listings/retirement/indiana/west_lafayette">the &#8220;Best Places to Retire&#8221; in the US</a>.</p>

<p>A job just opened up in the Math department for <a href="http://purdue.taleo.net/careersection/wl/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&amp;job=42620">a &#8220;Web Programmer/Analyst&#8221;</a>. This position calls for strong PHP, PostgreSQL and MySQL skills; Linux and Unix fu (you should be able to admin the web stack); good communication skills (you&#8217;ll be working with a number of different people with varying tech backgrounds); and plenty of independent motivation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not involved in the hiring process at all, but I&#8217;m friends with those who are, so if you have specific questions, I can route them to the right person. Please <em>email me directly</em> &#8211; do not post questions in the comments.</p>

<p>When Google AppEngine was announced, a lot of sturm und drang went through the PHP community because it only supported Python. Of course, the same thing went through the Ruby community. The Perl community, not so much, because they&#8217;re used to getting ignored.</p>

<p>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t really give a crap, because Python is a cool language, and I&#8217;ve been interested in learning new languages and frameworks lately. PHP is cool and all, but having done it for 9 years, you kinda look for new challenges. Plus, getting hung up on one language is a sure way to be a boring dude who gets caught up in lame religious language wars.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve actually toyed a little with Python here and there, but never dove in on a significant project. I&#8217;m someone who really <em>likes</em> whitespace and indenting rules and such, so those aspects of the language never bothered me. Otherwise, Python is a good fit for me philosophy-wise, because it&#8217;s totally the anti-Perl, lacking goofy magic characters and 1000 ways of doing the same thing. I can&#8217;t stand languages where &#8220;<code>~^s</code>&#8221; means &#8220;find all numbers that start with the letter &#8216;s&#8217;, add them, multiply them by 75, and then post the result to Twitter&#8221;. I&#8217;m not freakin&#8217; R2D2 here.</p>

<p>So anyway, I started working on a little side project with <a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne</a> on GAE. It&#8217;s been an enjoyable experience to work with a new language and framework, and there&#8217;s a lot to like about what GAE offers. It also has some rough edges, though, in some areas you&#8217;d be surprised by.</p>

<h3>The good</h3>

<h4>The webapp framework</h4>

<p>The built-in framework for handling requests is <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/webapp/"><strong>webapp</strong></a>, a nicely straightforward system for mapping requests to handlers.</p>

<pre><code>class MainPage(webapp.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.response.out.write('Sup dogg?')

class FooPage(webapp.RequestHandler)
    def get(self):
        self.response.out.write('This is the foo page')

def main():
    wapp = webapp.WSGIApplication([
                                    ('/', MainPage),
                                    ('/foo', FooPage)
                                  ],
                                  debug=True)

    wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(wapp)
</code></pre>

<p>So we define a class to handle a specific URL request, and define methods for <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> or whatever HTTP commands inside those classes. Then in the main function we map URLs to those handler classes in the <code>webapp.WSGIApplication</code> constructor, and then start it up.</p>

<p>I like this because it&#8217;s <em>simple</em> and easy to follow. I could read the code before I&#8217;d written any myself and get what&#8217;s going on. There&#8217;s no magic happening here; no auth-mapped stuff or relationships established because I happened to name something the right way and put it in the right directory. Convention is good, and we have conventions here, but the conventions are clear and obvious.</p>

<h4>Django templating</h4>

<p>Django has a really nice templating system. GAE lets you <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/templates.html">use it</a> outside of the whole Django stack. This is cool. For example:</p>

<pre><code># define some values to plug into the template
tpl_data = {
    'page_title':"This is an awesome page",
    'body':"Here's the page body, sucker"
    }

# get the template path
path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'index.html')

#render and output the template
self.response.out.write(template.render(path, tpl_data))
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s a super simple <code>index.html</code> template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{{ page_title.striptags }}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        {{ body }}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4>Google User Auth</h4>

<p>Writing a user system is a pain. Making people set up new accounts to use your site is yet another barrier to experiencing your amazing new <strike>Google sellout project</strike> site. You could presumably do these things if you want in GAE, but most of the time that seems kinda stupid. GAE offers you <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/users/">very easy integration with Google user accounts</a>, so you can use <em>that</em> as your authentication system. Since everyone and their mom has a Gmail account, it&#8217;s a pretty good bet many or most of your users will be able to skip account setup.</p>

<h4>Pricing</h4>

<p>GAE is free for your first 500MB of storage and &#8220;around&#8221; 5 million pageviews. That&#8217;s plenty to host a smallish app or do initial testing on something you want to get big (because big == profit, right?). If you push past that, the pricing is in-line with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">similar services from Amazon</a>. That means it&#8217;s totally reasonable to set up an app just for goofing around and learning.</p>

<h4>Python</h4>

<p>Python is a cool language: easy to pick up and quite powerful. It doesn&#8217;t fit some tasks as well as PHP IMHO, but it does a ton of stuff well, and its large community means there is lots of support and library development. Some stuff it does really well includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network programming (<a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1080010&amp;fromSeriesID=108">example</a>)</li>
<li>Parsing HTML</li>
<li>Email parsing and manipulation</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/mac/mac.html">OS X scripting</a></li>
<li>String manipulation</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Other stuff I probably don&#8217;t know about</li>
</ul>

<h4>AppEngineLauncher</h4>

<p>Recently the GAE team released the <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/05/app-engine-launcher-for-mac-os-x.html">Google App Engine Launcher</a>, an app for OS X that handles launching the development server and deploying your app to Google&#8217;s servers. You can of course script all this stuff yourself on the command line, but for folks less comfortable with that, this is a godsend. I actually did use the CLI before, but I don&#8217;t touch it now because the GAEL is just <a href="http://dudafly.ytmnd.com/">so fly</a>. Single-click deployment is especially awesome.</p>

<h4>Leveraging Google&#8217;s Infrastructure</h4>

<p>They gots some big computers, rite? You&#8217;d certainly think so, and they probably have better uptime than your $5 shared hosting account.  We hope.</p>

<h3>The lame</h3>

<h4>Datastore query limitations &amp; primitive text search</h4>

<p>The Datastore API is GAE&#8217;s database system. It has some similarities to traditional relational DBs like MySQL and PostgreSQL, but it is <em>fundamentally different</em>. It stores data objects as <em>entities</em> instead of rows, and properties instead of columns. Objects are described by <em>model</em> classes, defined in Python:</p>

<pre><code>class Page(db.Model):
    title = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    keywords = db.StringProperty()
    date_added = db.DateProperty(required=True)
    date_updated = db.DateProperty(required=True)
    body = db.StringProperty()
</code></pre>

<p>Models are to entities as classes are to objects, then (I think).</p>

<p>The object approach has some cool flexibility, like <em>expando</em> models that let you add arbitrary properties to entities (very <em>unlike</em> rows in a relational database).</p>

<p>You can do SQL-like queries against the Datastore with GQL. It&#8217;s a lot like SQL, but a lot more basic. In fact, this is a summary of the <em>entire</em> language:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM &lt;kind&gt;
[WHERE &lt;condition&gt; [AND &lt;condition&gt; ...]]
[ORDER BY &lt;property&gt; [ASC | DESC] [, &lt;property&gt; [ASC | DESC] ...]]
[LIMIT [&lt;offset&gt;,]&lt;count&gt;]
[OFFSET &lt;offset&gt;]

&lt;condition&gt; := &lt;property&gt; {&lt; | &lt;= | &gt; | &gt;= | = | != } &lt;value&gt;
&lt;condition&gt; := &lt;property&gt; IN &lt;list&gt;
&lt;condition&gt; := ANCESTOR IS &lt;entity or key&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This lets you do basic queries, but it&#8217;s missing a lot of powerful stuff present in SQL. Most notably there is no equivalent to the <code>LIKE</code> comparison operator. That means <strong>there is no way to do partial string matches!</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so you can do <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/b99bb87d9a3d05ab/8ca66b9241ccf73f?lnk=gst&amp;q=string+prefix+match#8ca66b9241ccf73f">kludgy prefix matching</a>, and there is an as-of-yet undocumented whole word search using <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/f64eacbd31629668/8dac5499bd58a6b7?lnk=gst&amp;q=searchablemodel#8dac5499bd58a6b7">the SearchableModel class</a>, but those are primitive compared to the string matching capabilities in MySQL. Personally  I would&#8217;ve thought that <em>the</em> search company would have given GAE really awesome text search capabilities out of the box, but for now folks have to roll their own hacks.</p>

<p>I guess now I have an idea of why Gmail&#8217;s search can&#8217;t match partial strings.</p>

<h4>No &#8220;beginner&#8221; docs</h4>

<p>GAE&#8217;s docs are aimed at experienced developers who have already built web apps. Most of it is reference, and it&#8217;s a little light on examples. If you&#8217;ve not used Python before, here&#8217;s the entire introduction form the GAE docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more information about Python, see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://python.org/">the Python website</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://docs.python.org/">the Python documentation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Python is easy to pick up, but GAE doesn&#8217;t even bother pointing out some good tutorials for beginners.  Compare this to <em><a href="http://djangobook.com/">The Django Book</a></em> or <em><a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/">The Definitive Guide to Symfony</a></em>, both of which aren&#8217;t really for beginners, but do a good job of helping them get up to speed.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&#8217;m early in my development experience with GAE, so this is by no means comprehensive. Google has already demonstrated that the GAE feature set will be growing, having introduced memcache and image manipulation APIs just a week ago. I&#8217;m sure the documentation will be improved and supplemented by third parties in short order, and the issues with text search will almost certainly be addressed soon &#8211; it&#8217;s an obvious deficiency.</p>

<p>For now, I&#8217;m having a lot of fun working with GAE. It&#8217;s a solid platform with a lot of promise, and it offers a lot of learning opportunities for folks who want to explore web app dev with Python.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It is true that you can any Python framework with CGI but only barebone. With Django and Pylons for example, you cannot use their native ORMs on GAE, you have to use GQL. Thus the code is not portable. This is not the case of web2py. The web2py ORM provides an abstraction layer that works with MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle/SQLite and GAE.</p>

<p>The Zip file has code in it. The PDF is viewable in plenty of apps, not just Acrobat (which I assume is what you&#8217;re complaining about). Try using one of them.</p>

<p>Also, telling me how it &#8220;suck&#8221;s to view the free stuff I&#8217;m giving you doesn&#8217;t get me excited about doing what you want. Consider a new approach.</p>

<p>Anyone who gets me liquored up knows that I&#8217;m not a fan of Wordpress. I think it&#8217;s <em>great</em> from a user (that is, the person writing the content) standpoint, but it has lagged behind severely in terms of security, and I don&#8217;t believe its popularity is the sole reason WP has been the subject of dozens of vulnerability reports every year. That being said, the WP 2.5 release appears to offer significant improvements in a couple areas: password hashes and cookie data encryption. From <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/" title="the WP blog">the WP blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Salted passwords &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like mod_auth_mysql we&#8217;ve created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>

<p>Secure cookies &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described in <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These are good steps, and while I think they took way too long to happen, I&#8217;m glad they finally did. I do still feel that WP suffers from an architecture that makes it too easy to make input filtering mistakes, and I would strongly recommend a tool like <a href="http://php-ids.org/2008/02/21/wpids-version-012-released/">WPIDS</a> for all self-hosting Wordpress users.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: This seems to have fixed itself one night. Maybe I rebooted? Who knows. Anyway, all seems good now.</p>

<hr />

<p>So I use <a href="http://www.sftpdrive.com/">SFTPDrive</a> on my Vista workstation at work to mount remote filesystems. It generally works pretty well, and I&#8217;ve never had an issue where a program didn&#8217;t treat my mount as a local drive &#8212; until I decided to give upgrading to <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/">Zend Studio for Eclipse</a> a go (licenses for which were generously donated to <a href="http://cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a> by <a href="http://zend.com">Zend</a>). For some reason, ZSfE just doesn&#8217;t show me my &#8220;k:&#8221; drive (the SFTP mount) when browsing for a project directory. This throws a real wrench in my usual workflow &#8212; ZS 5.5 had built-in SFTP support, and I could also use the local mount if I wanted.</p>

<p>I did look in Zend&#8217;s Support KB and the forums, but did not come across anything like this. Have you? Any alternatives for directly connecting and editing over SFTP?</p>

Initially I had experimented with the Remote Systems stuff and making a &#8220;Remote Project,&#8221; but that didn&#8217;t appear to support any kind of &#8220;code insight&#8221;-type stuff, which is really the main reason I use an IDE.</p>

<p>I was also frustrated to find that the info on creating SFTP connections in the Help info is just plain <em>wrong</em>. It puts FTP and SFTP in the same boat, but the directions actually only work for plain FTP connections.  This kind of documentation goofiness seems to have plagued Zend for quite a while now.</p>

<h3>The experience of SXSW</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unlike other conferences I&#8217;ve been to, which were mostly tech confs SXSWi is not about nuts and bolts &#8212; it&#8217;s about higher level issues of people using technology

<ul>
<li>A couple exceptions, like the <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060469">Secrets of JavaScript Libraries</a>. This was good, and I&#8217;d like to see more like this. I don&#8217;t expect hardcore advanced code talks, but good intro-level stuff would go a long way, I think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At most confs I attend, I&#8217;m the &#8220;weird&#8221; dude, with my earrings and black t-shirts. At SXSW I&#8217;m another asshole with a fauxhawk.</li>
<li>Way, way, way more women at SXSWi than any tech conf. Someone on a panel I attended complained that the % of females has been going down at SXSWi, and I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s maybe 35-40% female. At most of the tech conferences I go, it&#8217;s 5-10% female, tops.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that web apps are one of the primary points of attacks for malicious users, security was really not talked about much at SXSW (although I heard there was some in the <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060295">OpenID panel</a>). This was disappointing. People running web apps are the stewards of their users security and privacy, a responsibility not to be taken likely. I&#8217;d wager under 20% of attendees and panelists could describe basic techniques for architecting software with security in mind (but I hope it&#8217;s higher). Definitely need to propose a panel for 2009.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The culture of Austin</h3>

<ul>
<li>People really do seem more hospitable. Locals will ask a stranger how there night&#8217;s going. This is pleasant, but a little weird for a yanqui when it happens in the men&#8217;s room.</li>
<li>Austin embraces being different. They <em>like</em> it, from the top down. This is so unlike most other communities.</li>
<li>Austin doesn&#8217;t feel like a big city. It has some big, cool buildings, but you&#8217;ll see flop houses a couple blocks away. </li>
<li>Closest thing I&#8217;ve experienced to Austin is Portland. I think PDX has better public transportation. Austin&#8217;s weather doesn&#8217;t cause city-wide suicide watches, though.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other tidbits</h3>

<p>Introduced <a href="http://clintecker.com/">Clint Ecker</a> to <a href="http://sneer.org/">Jason Perkins</a>, both Chicago-based web devs. They discover that they work literally next door from one another.</p>

<hr />

<p>Had lunch with Jason Perkins and the rest of the <a href="http://pixish.com">Pixish</a> crew. Surprisingly was not mocked incessantly for not using Rails. They&#8217;re good peeps, and Pixish is a cool site.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wonder how far <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/allfacebook/videos/13/">the Zuckerberg &#8220;keynote&#8221;</a> set back female journalism. That&#8217;s a hari-kari situation right there.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are unwilling to say to someone&#8217;s face what you say in your little gadget (or otherwise) blog, you need to shut up. Stop being a punk.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was really happy to see <a href="http://ExpressionEngine.com">ExpressionEngine</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> represented as strongly as they were at SXSW. I still feel strongly that EE is the strongest CMS product in its market (which includes Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress and the like), and the improvements in EE2.0&#8217;s administration system will increase productivity considerably.</p>

<hr />

<p>Holy shit, I have never seen as many iPhones as I did there. And it&#8217;s taking some effort on my part to not go get one now. I could have left my laptop in the hotel room if I&#8217;d had one, which would have reduced my fatigue considerably. Since I am doing about 4 conferences a year, it&#8217;s starting to make more sense. I&#8217;m making myself wait for a new hardware revision, though (and I really can&#8217;t afford one atm).</p>

<hr />

<p>The panel on the success of <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">icanhascheezburger.com</a> was interesting, and I think underlines that <em>luck</em> is a (the?) key component for almost all of these rags-to-riches stories</p>

<hr />

<p>Being <em>with</em> someone &#8212; or a small group &#8212; seems key to me. I think I would have enjoyed SXSWi a lot less if I was not able to always count on the two friends I was with.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do not be afraid to come up and talk to people. It&#8217;s hard for me to do, but I was always glad I did. I got to meet old internet-only friends like <a href="http://tinynibbles.com">Violet Blue</a> because of this (so glad I did!). I also got a hug from <a href="http://www.lifestudent.com/">Halcyon</a>, which was awesome &#8212; more dudes should be down with hugs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meeting <a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne</a> was another highlight of SXSW for me. What a great guy; I wish we&#8217;d had more time to hang and talk. And there were so many others, like <a href="http://www.derekallard.com/">Derek Allard</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca">Jonathan Snook</a>, <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=bio&amp;id=171397">Ken Fisher</a> (thanks again for dinner Monday night), <a href="http://www.tripledogdaremedia.com/">Thomas Myer</a>, <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=bio&amp;id=139146">C. Eric Smith</a>, <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a> (I wish he&#8217;d written Rails), <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a>, and many others whom I&#8217;m too forgetful to remember at the moment.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=bio&amp;id=174538">Frank Warren</a>&#8217;s keynote on his <a href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/">PostSecret</a> project was the highlight of SXSW for me. It was funny, tragic, inspiring, and compelling. One could not help but be inspired, as exemplified by the man who asked his love to marry him in front of the entire audience. Technology empowering us to express ourselves, communicate, and aid one another is so much of what the last few years in web dev has been about, and we would do well to follow the example set by Frank Warren.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh hell yes I&#8217;m coming back next year</p>

<h3><a href="http://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a> 2.0 will be powered by <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>CI gains abstracted querying</li>
<li>New CI libs like the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/forge.html">DBForge</a> built to support EE 2.0</li>
<li>EE Session library more powerful</li>
<li>EE Form gen and HTML gen</li>
<li><p><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> built into EE now</p></li>
<li><p>Basically, if EE needs something, CI gets new feature</p></li>
<li>Performance and simplicity still top priority</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes coming in EE 2.0</h3>

<ul>
<li>new CP theme designed from scratch</li>
<li>CP uses MVC pattern (CP has always been decoupled from EE&#8217;s frontend stuff)</li>
<li>CP has nice DHTML stuff driven by jquery - sortable tables, dynamic search results/filtering, ajax paging (retains sorting settings), pretty animations</li>
<li>New CP is very task-oriented: Create, Modify, View are primary sections, all available from opening</li>
<li>Top Bar: Content, Design, Add-Ons, Members, Admin, Tools</li>
<li>Nice little footer tabs called Accessories. Default are Learning EE stuff, EE News and site stats

<ul>
<li>Accessories can be added much like modules or plugins</li>
<li>Accessory creation doesn&#8217;t require PHP knowledge (but it helps to do more awesome stuff)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admin area no longer has Utilities

<ul>
<li>Content Admin and System Admin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Members have own section</li>
<li>Edit form shows nice dhtml tabs;

<ul>
<li>can create custom tabs from edit form</li>
<li>can add/edit custom fields from edit form</li>
<li>fields are resortable by dragging</li>
<li>full-page write mode for any field</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I use a service called <a href="http://103bees.com">103bees</a> to track what search terms and questions are directing people to Funkatron.com. Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s selections:</p>

<h2>Search terms</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>lil wyte photo</code></p>

<p>I have no idea.</p></li>
<li><p><code>download hardly wait juliette lewis</code></p>

<p>I really like that version of <a href="http://www.pjharvey.net/lyrics/demos_hardly.html">the PJ Harvey song</a>, as sung by Juliette Lewis in the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558/combined">Strange Days</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>free .mac account mail only</code></p>

<p>Not here!</p></li>
<li><p><code>funkatron twitter air</code></p>

<p>Presumably someone who heard <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> mentioned on <a href="http://www.twit.tv/mbw77">MacBreak Weekly</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>visualize kcachegrind os x</code></p>

<p>I think I <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/kcachegrind_equivalent_for_os_x/">posted</a> about how much of a gigantic pain in the ass this was to get running on OS X.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ghetto fackin</code></p>

<p>mmmmm no.</p></li>
<li><p><code>spry click tab reload data</code></p>

<p>I have talked about <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a> a fair bit here, so I guess that makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p><code>matt sink</code></p>

<p>No idea</p></li>
<li><p><code>debian parallels tools</code></p>

<p>Ah, I did make a post about getting Debian running on Parallels. Or more accurately, the fact that <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/installing_a_debian_vm_using_parallels/">I got it running</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>spaz app</code></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard of this</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>how to use monospace fonts in illustrator cs2</code></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve posted a tip about <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/rounding_corners_in_illustrator/">rounded rect corners in Illustrator</a>, and monospaced <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/fonts_for_programming/">fonts for programming</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>what are the things on my penis</code></p>

<p>Can&#8217;t help you, bro. I did write once that <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/im_scared_to_put_things_in_my_penis/">I&#8217;m scared to put things <em>in</em> my penis</a>, tho.</p></li>
<li><p><code>php 6 when is coming out</code></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know when, but I know why I&#8217;m looking forward to it!</p></li>
<li><p><code>what are the chances of getting tax audited</code></p>

<p>I <a href="http://funkatron.com/index.php/site/comments/what_are_your_chances_of_getting_audited_by_the_irs/">reposted something about this</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>there was an error: typeerror: undefined value flickr mac os x</code></p>

<p>Pretty much every app I&#8217;ve ever written has tons of errors in it, so this could be anything.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://inspekt.org"><img src="/content/inspekt_logo_v1.png" alt="Inspekt" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded the 0.3 release of <a href="http://inspekt.org" title="the input filtering and validation library for PHP4 and 5">Inspekt</a>, the input filtering and validation library for PHP4 and 5. With this release, Inspekt completes the goals of the original specification for the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007_Applications#EdFinkler_-_A_comprehensive_input_retrieval.2Ffiltering_system_for_PHP" title="OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 Applications - OWASP">SpoC007 project
</a>. I believe it is ready for &#8220;real-world&#8221; use.</p>

<p>Along with this release, there are new support and install options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand new <a href="http://funkatron.com/inspekt/user_docs" title="Inspekt User Docs">user documentation</a> - written by an actual human (well, me, so close enough)</li>
<li>Updated <a href="http://funkatron.com/inspekt/api_docs/" title="Inspekt API Docs">API documentation</a> generated with <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org/" title="phpDocumentor: The complete documentation solution for PHP">phpDocumentor</a></li>
<li>A PEAR channel (<a href="http://pear.funkatron.com" title="pear.funkatron.com">pear.funkatron.com</a>) for quick packaged installs</li>
<li>A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/inspekt" title="inspekt | Google Groups">discussion group/mailing list</a> for support, suggestions and discussion</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s new in this release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated filtered via external config files</li>
<li>Cleanup and fixes to docblocks</li>
<li>More example code</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/inspekt/web/inspekt_logo_v1.png" title="Fruity">A fruity logo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interact with developers to get feedback and implement suggestions</li>
<li>Add new options for URI, email, phone # validators</li>
<li>Work with framework developers to integrate Inspekt with their platforms</li>
<li>Better support the special requirements of session data</li>
<li>Integration with PHP5&#8217;s filtering API when available</li>
<li>Integration with other filtering and escaping systems like <a href="http://php-ids.org/" title="PHPIDS &raquo; Web Application Security 2.0 &raquo; Index">PHPIDS</a> and <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/" title="HTML Purifier - Filter your HTML the standards-compliant way!">HTML Purifier</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in contributing to Inspekt in <em>any</em> way, I highly encourage you to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/inspekt" title="inspekt | Google Groups">join the mailing list</a>.  I&#8217;m especially looking for development assistance and &#8220;real-world&#8221; feedback.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in my years as a grown-up, it&#8217;s this: Don&#8217;t make assumptions.  All too often, things I&#8217;ve thought were no-brainers turned out to be <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-belief.html">questionable at best</a>, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Romero will make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana">an awesome game</a> on his own</li>
<li>Sony and Microsoft have made Nintendo <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/12/14/business/20071214_WII_GRAPHIC.html">irrelevant</a></li>
<li>Women will find my company tolerable</li>
</ul>

<p>I often see techie types making <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/hastygeneralisation.html">assumptions based on their experience</a>, like &#8220;program A is unusable&#8221; (because on his rather oddly set-up system, it crashed on install) or &#8220;no real programmers write in Ruby&#8221; (because he doesn&#8217;t know anyone personally who do) or &#8220;only a tiny fraction of Mac users browse with Firefox&#8221; (because it&#8217;s the default browser out of the box, and average users always use the default, right?).</p>

<p>It was this last assertion, and the accompanying statement &#8220;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html">I don&#8217;t have to prove something so obvious</a>&#8221; that inspired this article. I wouldn&#8217;t have been particularly surprised if Safari had a majority of the Mac browser market, but my personal experience had been that a fair number of non-techie Mac folks use Firefox. Beyond that, I wanted to get some <em>real data</em>, and not make assumptions. If you can&#8217;t provide some basis for your assertions, they&#8217;re not worth much. It&#8217;s a clear sign of a bad <a href="http://www.fallacyfiles.org/glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>, and little gets me more worked up than weak logic.</p>

<p>The audience for a web site has a pretty significant impact on what browsers we see visitors using. Tech-oriented sites tend to have a higher percentage of users running alternate browsers like Firefox. You&#8217;ll get more <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> users on a Mac-oriented site, and <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a> will show up more often on sites with content for Linux users. That means we have to at least take into account the content of the site when drawing conclusions from the numbers.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found myself, and what others have shared with me, so far.  Understandably, some folks shared their stats with me asked to remain anonymous, or that the site they come from not be revealed. I&#8217;ve described them as best I can.  Also note that in some cases I received just info on Mac browsers, and others I had data for all browsers. I&#8217;ve calculated a ratio and &#8220;winner&#8221; at the end of each entry.</p>

<p>Is this data <em>conclusive</em>? Of course not. It&#8217;s a small sample of a handful of sites, and not particularly popular ones at that. But, it does seem to at least indicate that Firefox may be quite a bit more popular among Mac users than I &#8211; and certainly other people &#8211; thought.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute data, just drop me a line or leave a comment.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Very interesting post. I was watching the exchange that prompted this post, and I too was intrigued by the claim. I did a little searching via Google and the only data I could quickly find was overall browser and OS market share reports. The numbers I saw indicated a 6% Mac OS share and a 5% Safari share. Combining these, you get about a 17% share of non-Safari browsers on Mac OS.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t put any stock in those numbers, I was just interested in what data was out there since a 10% or less share for Firefox on Macs seemed low to me. I find your data more compelling, and more in line with what I would expect, although that of course means little.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post.</p>

<p><a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne</a> did a much better job <a href="http://www.al3x.net/2007/11/minimalism-in-code.html">expressing this</a> that I could in my slightly addled state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I enjoy programming in Ruby, but it doesn&#8217;t have the crisp simplicity that I prefer. Syntactical shortcuts inherited from Perl combined with upteen different ways to write a given expression make the language extremely flexible, but also extremely complex. It&#8217;s possible to write clean, minimal Ruby, but such code rarely takes full advantage of the language. Idiomatic Ruby is powerful but complicated. While Ruby programs are often shorter than their equivalents in other languages, line density frequently offsets length for rapid comprehension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s always something I&#8217;ve noticed with Ruby - that it borrows too many &#8220;magic symbols&#8221; from Perl for my liking. I strongly dislike idiomatic code because reading it is too much like parsing hieroglyphics. To some extent you&#8217;re gonna get that with any computer language, and a lot of it is dependent on what you&#8217;re used to syntactically, but I do think there are tendencies for some languages to be more or less &#8220;readable.&#8221; PHP does a pretty decent job of it; I think Python is even better in this regard, and probably why I dig the language a lot.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s some tough calculus. Martin Fowler would argue that expressiveness in a language makes developers more productive. Expressiveness and terseness go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>For example, there is a lot of debate in Java about adding closures to the language. Does Java need the expressiveness of closures, or will its terseness make Java code harder to develop/maintain? Closures are common enough in other languages that the expressiveness argument probably wins out. Some of the hard-to-grok terseness of Ruby is from Perl, as you mentioned and not common to other scripting languages like PHP and Python.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip. I&#8217;ll look into Lua.</p>

<p>Michael,</p>

<p>Smarter people than me can certainly make better arguments on this topic. ;) However, I do find that as much as I like closures in Javascript, I also see them making my code harder to maintain. That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m willing to give them up, though, because they&#8217;re super cool.</p>

<p>Clearly the free booze and other gifts provided to the <a href="http://phparch.com">php|arch</a> team is paying off, as two of my talks have been accepted for <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek 2008</a> in Chicago. I&#8217;ll be speaking on desktop app development with <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">AIR</a>, and the <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> project.  <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/c/schedule">The full schedule of talks</a> will help you plan on how best to avoid me.</p>

<p>Desktop app dev with <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">AIR</a> has been something near and dear to my heart lately, as I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in the past several months developing <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client based on AIR.  In the process I&#8217;ve learned a whole heck of a lot about Javascript development, and learned intimately what works well in AIR and what doesn&#8217;t. Combining PHP on the server side and Javascript/HTML on the client side makes a lot of sense for me, then. Getting the two sides to work together has gotten a fair bit easier with the <a href="http://php.net/json">JSON extension</a> that was added in PHP 5.2.0.  With that, exchange of data structures carries a lot less overhead.</p>

<p><a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> has been quiet for a while on the development side, but I&#8217;m hoping things will pick up a bit with the introduction of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpsecinfo">public SVN access</a> to the project. The trunk version has some extra stuff in it, like the beginnings of a new view system to output results in various formats.  I&#8217;ve also added <a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com/">Paul Reinheimer</a> as a contributor, so feel free to guilt him into making updates as well.  If you&#8217;re interested in contributing patches or updates to PHPSecInfo, drop me a line and we&#8217;ll chat.</p>

<p>Maintaining focus has never been one of my strong suits, but I&#8217;ve been doing a fairly bad job of it lately even for me. So, I&#8217;m <em>finally</em> posting the slides from my two talks a DC PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/Securing%20the%20PHP%20Environment%20With%20PhpSecInfo.pdf">Securing the PHP Environment with PHPSecInfo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/Inspekt-DCPHP-Slides.pdf">Secure PHP Development with Inspekt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I think my talks went okay, but not great. Definitely could have been more prepared and presented more useful information, especially in the Inspekt talk. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve done a talk on that project, so I still am feeling that one out a bit, whereas I&#8217;ve talked about PHPSecInfo a few times before this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dcphpconference.com/">DC PHP Conference</a> was a nice surprise. It was clearly still in the learning stages, but everyone was friendly and happy to help, and the organizers definitely seemed interested in sorting out what worked and what didn&#8217;t. I believe they said the next one will be in July 2008; I hope to be there!</p>

I&#8217;m not dead &#8212; I&#8217;m just busy.  Spaz has had a few long-standing issues since the upgrade to AIR Beta 2, and this new version (0.3.0) fixes many of them. If you already have Spaz, just go to the Prefs tab > Upgrades > Check Now. If you don&#8217;t have Spaz installed, you can install it from <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">the Spaz homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what&#8217;s new in 0.3.0:</p>

<p>3.0 (2007-10-30)</p>

<ul>
<li>All timelines now retrieve all data, not just from last 24 hours (including DMs, @s, sent messages, followers/following lists)</li>
<li>New theme: &#8220;Dumb Terminal.&#8221; Works best on Windows with Bistream Vera Sans Mono or Iconsolata font; OS X has readable mono fonts by default</li>
<li>New window behaviors: Minimize to systray (on by default), minimize when in background, restore when in foreground</li>
<li>Added Native Shell Menus under OS X</li>
<li>Added System Tray Icon in Windows w/ context menu</li>
<li>Added Dock item menu</li>
<li>User-defined CSS tweaks file now works again</li>
<li>Tweets can now be &#8220;selected.&#8221; Hit &#8216;@&#8217; (SHIFT+2) to send reply to selected tweet&#8217;s user</li>
<li>Prefs that require restart to be applied are now indicated</li>
<li>Better descriptions of data retrieval errors; should properly determine if response timed out or if request limit is exceeded</li>
<li>Fixed charcount to reset properly after successful send</li>
<li>Added simple DOM context menus - currently allow user to copy URLs to clipboard</li>
<li>Use &#8216;-khtml-user-select&#8217; to limit selectability of elements; should eliminate many problems with onlick operations</li>
<li>Popup panels should work a bit better; center properly and drag more easily. Popup panels will be moved to modal windows soon</li>
<li>Upgraded to jQuery 1.2.1</li>
<li>Dumped Interface lib, added jQuery.UI lib</li>
<li>Fixed size of protected post icon</li>
<li>Lots of code cleanup and refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve also created <a href="http://funkatron.com/content/UserCSS_A_Simple_Example.swf" target="_blank">a simple screencast</a> in <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a> to show off what I think is one of the coolest, most underused Spaz features: User CSS tweaks. It lets you load up your own CSS file to modify the current theme. If you don&#8217;t like the font size or a color, you can change it yourself, without having to author a whole theme.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/UserCSS_A_Simple_Example.swf" target="_blank">Screencast: UserCSS in Spaz - a simple example</a> (Flash required)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&#8217;t record any audio with this screencast, as I didn&#8217;t have a decent mic handy.  Hope it&#8217;s still helpful!</p>

<p>As always, direct bug reports, questions or suggestions to <a href="http://twitter.com/spaz">Spaz at Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://www.derekallard.com/">Derek Allard</a>, of <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> fame, <a href="http://www.derekallard.com/blog/post/bambooinvoice-may-be-moving-away-from-the-gpl-open-source-license/">is concerned</a> about the GPL licensing he chose for his open-source web application <a href="http://www.bambooinvoice.org/">BambooInvoice</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around February of this year, a CodeIgniter user contacted me privately to point out that someone was re-distributing BambooInvoice as their own work.  I&#8217;m not going to use any names or URLs (no point in adding any publicity to them), but they essentially called it &#8220;their business&#8221;-Invoice.  So they offered it for download under a different name, and claimed it was their invoicing software.  They offered a &#8220;demo&#8221; (identical in every way to Bamboo) and it was apparent to me that all they really did was a giant search and replace of the word &#8220;Bamboo&#8221; with &#8220;their business&#8221;.  No credit to me.  No mention of Bamboo, no CodeIgniter license (that was visible), nothing - just a wholesale search and replace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Derek has clearly thought about this issue a lot, but I bet he could use some sage advice from people who have been through similar situations.  If you have, please consider reading <a href="http://www.derekallard.com/blog/post/bambooinvoice-may-be-moving-away-from-the-gpl-open-source-license/">his post</a> and offering some input. Derek&#8217;s given a lot to the OSS community via CodeIgniter, and I think we should help him out here.</p>

<p>I like open source because I usually like to customize an application to what I need it to do, but if my company&#8217;s purpose is to deliver &#8216;boxed&#8217; web solutions such as an e-commerce package:
1. What&#8217;s stopping someone from buying the software once and redistributing it like the BambooInvoice software.
2. What is the best way to keep track of people using your software, in case they purchase one license but use the software on more than one domain name?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Daniel Errante, 
     Open-source can be used to leverage a well defined and constructed business. What I think you have overlooked is that hiding code only stops people for a short time. Any software can be reversed engineered, eventually. A good business can adapt quickly before some competitor will put them out of business. Open Source like the GPL can help in many ways like TiVO, they use the linux kernel and repurpose it. With many programming hours and the proper hardware one could recreate that and sell it (those who have see the technical side not the business side of ow to get clients and distribute the product, but that is beside the point). In the case of BambooInvoice (way different case) , I think he should prosecute the company for stealing not repurposing his code. Making a business of more than 80% that was not developed or planned from that company is downright stealing!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am hesitant to encrypt my code first because it seems costly and second, I agree that the code can be broken. Apple spent a long time locking down the iPhone only to have hackers break in two months later. It seems like a wasted effort, however with PHP, I can&#8217;t tell if someone is using my code, selling it or re-writing it. I would just like to know! At least Apple knows when they are breaking in to the phone. They are actually profiting more from the hacker&#8217;s purchase of the iPhone!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just to be clear, my goal is NOT to prevent people from seeing code, customizing, or using BambooInvoice&#8230; my concern mostly was that they could take the work, and essentially claim it as their own.  When I saw it I thought &#8220;darn, what actual recourse do I have here&#8230; doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;ve broken the GPL I distributed BI under&#8221;.  So really, I just want something that explicitly says &#8220;hey, modify to your hearts content, but no pretending this work is your work&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As far as my understanding goes Copyright notices cannot be removed under GPL - removing them is a violation of GPL itself - and even if I am wrong there Section 7b of GPL V3 allows you to place additional terms which require preservation of any reasonable legal notices or author attributions.</p>

<p>for further reference I guess you can also contact http://gpl-violations.org/</p>

<p>I am pleased as punch to finally be able to announce publicly that <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client I developed in HTML and Javascript for the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe Integrated Runtime</a>, has won <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/air_derby_winners.html">&#8220;Best HTML Community Application&#8221;</a> in the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/showcase/special/airderby/">AIR Develper Derby</a>.</p>

<p>I submitted Spaz as something of an afterthought, to be honest. I had received some good feedback on it from a couple people at Adobe, but I didn&#8217;t think it was <em>all that</em>, so to speak.  Throughout the development process I avoided looking at what other developers were doing, especially other Twitter devs, because I was sure it would send me into a tailspin of despair at the bush league-ness of my own kung fu.  After all, Spaz is the first &#8220;Rich Internet Application&#8221; I&#8217;ve written. I hadn&#8217;t even written an AJAX call in any code up until Spaz.</p>

<p>So, receiving this award is a great surprise to me, and very encouraging.  There are a lot of <em>great</em> Twitter clients out there, and this makes me believe that Spaz is at least in the ballpark.  Or, as <a href="http://www.calevans.com/">Cal Evans</a> put it far more succinctly, &#8220;Spaz doesn&#8217;t suck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks to all the users of Spaz, and everyone who has given me feedback. I wrote Spaz because I wanted people to <em>use</em> it, and everyone who does gives me a great deal of encouragement.  And very special thanks to those who have given me feedback &#8212; Spaz is an &#8220;award-winning&#8221; app thanks to you.</p>

<p>BTW, I&#8217;m at <a href="http://www.adobemax2007.com/na/">AdobeMAX2007</a> in Chicago now, so if you&#8217;re an attendee and want to chat about Spaz, drop me a line.</p>

<p>Now, onward to <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html">AIR Beta 2</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tychay/1381970953/in/set-72157602016776951"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1226/1381970953_fd15b3e524.jpg" alt="php|works - it's about the booze. Photo by Terry Chay" title="php|works - it's about the booze. Photo by Terry Chay" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://works.phparch.com/">php|works 2007</a> was last week, and it was a great experience for me.  Here are the slides and code from the presentations I gave:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/EdFinkler-Introduction%20to%20CodeIgniter.pdf">Introduction to CodeIgniter</a></strong>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/CI-talk.zip">Example app used in talk &#8212; includes CodeIgniter and ZendFramework</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/EdFinkler-Securing%20the%20PHP%20Environment%20With%20PhpSecInfo.pdf">Securing the PHP Environment With PHPSecInfo</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoyed my trip to Atlanta and the conference experience. Much like php|tek this year in Chicago, &#8216;works was filled with lots of great content, smart people, and a casual, comfortable atmosphere that makes the whole thing a lot of fun. The <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a> conferences lack pretension, and that&#8217;s really nice &#8212; it&#8217;s about the people and sharing knowledge. And this one was really special for me because it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve given a presentation to my colleagues in the community.  I was very nervous, but it all turned out well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to write out an extended journal of the whole experience, but here are some memorable moments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being sick just two days before I was about to leave, and getting better just in time to go</li>
<li>Having my first flight cancelled, giving me time to mostly finish my CodeIgniter talk before I left the Indy airport</li>
<li>Getting to the hotel just in time to catch <a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett</a>&#8217;s funny PHP4 is Dead keynote</li>
<li>Discovering the hotel room had a flat-panel TV. Unfortunately, no HD content</li>
<li>Catching up with Lucas Nealan, and getting an unexpected phonecall with great news</li>
<li>The fact that there were about 7,000 iPhones on-hand</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.preinheimer.com/">Paul Reinheimer</a> quad-core drinking demo (sponsored by Microsoft)</li>
<li><em>Ramblecast</em>: the loudest, drunkest, least productive group podcasting experiment ever</li>
<li>Learning a lot more about <a href="http://php.net/filter">the Filter extension</a> from <a href="http://www.derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and seeing how it compares to <a href="http://inspekt.org">Inspekt</a></li>
<li>Losing power in the middle of my <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> talk, and <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a> resuscitating the projector</li>
<li><a href="http://terrychay.com">Terry Chay</a>&#8217;s software architecture talk. I didn&#8217;t agree with everything he said, but I laughed my ass off</li>
<li>Meeting people who have actually heard of me and used tools I&#8217;ve made. Weird</li>
<li>Good conversations with too many people to name</li>
</ul>

Terry&#8217;s friend <a href="http://karenism.com/" title="Karen Nguyen">Karen Nguyen</a> kindly agreed to represent me at the event in the off chance that I won something&#8230; and I did!</p>

<p>This Friday, I&#8217;ll be giving two talks at <a href="http://works.phparch.com">php|works Atlanta</a>: one on <a href="http://codeigniter.com">the CodeIgniter framework</a>, and one on <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PhpSecInfo</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/schedule/talk/d2s4/2">Intro to CodeIgniter</a></h3>

<p><em>September 14, 2007 @ 1:15 &#8211; 2:15pm</em></p>

<p>CodeIgniter is an open-source web application framework written in PHP. Created by EllisLab, CI is descended from the ExpressionEngine CMS system, and therefore has a focus on real-world needs and solutions for PHP developers. CI is easy to deploy, and works with a wide variety of environments (even FTP-only shared hosting accounts). It offers powerful features like MVC and ActiveRecord without requiring the developer to adhere to strict coding guidelines. It&#8217;s easy to extend, and plays well with other code libraries like PEAR and Zend Framework.</p>

<p>In this talk we&#8217;ll go over the basics of CI: how to deploy it and writing a simple application. As time allows, we&#8217;ll discuss how to extend the framework with other libraries.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://works.phparch.com/mats/Ed-codeigniter.mp3">Audio preview of the session</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://works.phparch.com">Securing the PHP Environment With PhpSecInfo</a></h3>

<p><em>September 14, 2007 @ 4:30 &#8211; 5:30pm</em></p>

<p>PhpSecInfo is an easy to use security auditing tool for the PHP Environment. We&#8217;ll discuss how to use PhpSecInfo as part of your web app security toolkit, and how to customize and extend it for your specific needs, including using the Zend_Environment_Security module from the Zend Framework.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://works.phparch.com/mats/Ed-phpsecinfo.mp3">Audio preview of the session</a></li>

Developing themes for Spaz can be kinda tough, because you need to restart the app each time you make a CSS change.  To make things easier, I&#8217;ve put together a template that you can load in your browser and use with standard CSS editing tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://jaredlouche.livejournal.com/">Jared Louche</a> from <a href="http://hydrogenbar.com">Chemlab</a> has been dropping some really cool artists in his journal, and I wanted to share them here to spread the virus and whatnot.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motorcitynix/sets/72057594121138132/">Bob Nixon</a></h3>

<p>A dirty, deadly, gorgeous mash of shlock horror, hot rods, pin-ups and two-color grime, Bob Nixon&#8217;s design work is sure to please punk, rockabilly, and horror culture fans alike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motorcitynix/206785582/in/set-72057594121138132"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/206785582_05f629b0b0.jpg" class="centered" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motorcitynix/563279544/in/set-72057594121138132/"><img alt="Bob Nixon - Zombie Rock - The 13th Victim" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1421/563279544_1179cafb9c.jpg" class="centered" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motorcitynix/454039051/in/set-72057594121138132/"><img alt="Bob Nixon - Crud & Mushroomhead v2" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/243/454039051_e16a40a7b4.jpg" class="centered" /></a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/">Cyberoptix</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve had Deathany Shorb/Toybreaker on my Flickr contacts for a while, because she has some really great pics of run-down houses and industrial wastelands, but she also makes <a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/">AMAZING ties</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/screw.php"><img src="http://www.cyberoptix.com/images/screw/goldscrew380.jpg" class="centered" alt="CyberOptix - Screw" /></a></p>

<p>If I ever wore ties, I&#8217;d wear hers!</p>

<p>Matt Mullenweg, the dude behind Wordpress, has posted something of <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/07/13/on-php/">a rant</a> about PHP5 in the light of the upcoming drop of PHP4 support:</p>

<blockquote>None of the most requested features for WordPress would be any easier (or harder) if they were written for PHP 4 or 5 or Python. They&rsquo;d just be different. The hard part usually has little to do with the underlying server-side language.</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a hint: don&#8217;t give the users what they <em>say</em> they want until you give them what they <em>need.</em> &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t realize what that is.  Here&#8217;s some PHP5-only features that could be helping Wordpress users <em>right now</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Parameterized SQL input to eliminate SQL injection attacks (security)</strong><br />
Strictly enforcing the use of parameterized SQL input in Wordpress development would dramatically reduce, and in all likelyhood <em>eliminate</em>, the possibility of SQL  injection attacks against Wordpress.  Using <a href="http://us.php.net/pdo">the PHP5-only PDO extension</a> would allows this <em>even with databases that don&#8217;t natively support this feature</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://us.php.net/filter">Filter extension</a> to combat XSS, CSRF, etc. attacks (security)</strong><br />
The PHP5-only filter extension adds fast, built-in input filtering functions.  Given the history of problems Wordpress has with handling user input properly, enforcing the use of this or another solid input filtering system would surely reduce the amount of input handling errors in the WP codebase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turning off remote file inclusion by default (security)</strong><br />
Remote file inclusion vulnerabilities account for approximately 40% of all security issues with PHP-based applications.  The <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php#ini.allow-url-include"><code>allow_url_include</code></a> configuration setting, added in PHP 5.2.0, disables remote file inclusion by default.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepared statement/transaction support in <a href="http://us.php.net/pdo">PDO</a> and <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php">MySQLi</a> (performance)</strong><br />
Prepared statements not only provide the benefits of parameterized input mentioned above, but significant performance increases can be had with them.  AFAIK, it&#8217;s not possible to support these features in MySQL under PHP4.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php">Improved OOP features</a> and support (code quality, extensibility)</strong><br />
This would aid developers first, which in turn would benefit users, by making (in my opinion and based on anecdotal evidence) a large project like Wordpress easier to maintain.  Code reusability is improved, quality is increased, and hackish approaches like global variables become unnecessary.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve hacked the guts of Wordpress and written numerous plugins, and I&#8217;m <em>still</em> shocked at what a garbled mess the WP codebase is, and how much easier it is to write extensions for content management systems that embrace OOP.  Of course, OOP is very possible in PHP4, but PHP5 adds a number of features that make a significant difference in team development (public/private/protected properties and methods, for example).</p>

<p>(A cynic might suggest that one reason to <em>not</em> clean up the WP architecture is because that would break backwards compatibility with the extensive library of plugins that has a lot to do with Wordpress&#8217; success.  There would be some irony in that, no?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think this line from Matt&#8217;s post might be telling:</p>

<blockquote>Even hosted PHP-powered services who have no shared host compatibility concerns like 30boxes, Digg, Flickr, and WordPress.com, have been slow to move and when they do it will probably be because of speed or security, not features.</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, support of PHP5-only features in WP would give it better speed and security <em>right now</em>.  And especially in the case of security, Matt&#8217;s reliance on what users <em>say</em> they want is a critical error: users don&#8217;t ask about security until well after it becomes a serious issue.  Wordpress has one of the worst security records of any PHP application, so I&#8217;ll go out on a limb and say that it&#8217;s a problem <strong>now</strong>.  Even if WP users aren&#8217;t talking about it, <strong>WP&#8217;s core dev team should have addressed this already</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve said before that web app developers are the stewards of their users&#8217; data.  Our users need and expect us to anticipate and address their security.  If we don&#8217;t do that, and simply <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/appealtopopularity.html">base our actions on popular opinion</a>, we&#8217;re being <strong>irresponsible</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a basically unrelated note, it <em>really</em> is disappointing to see Matt sink to <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/personalattack.html">ad-hominem attacks</a> when making his argument:</p>

<blockquote>In 2007, [the PHP site] still doesn&rsquo;t have obvious permalinks. They do have a RSS 1.0 feed though, remember those?</blockquote>

<blockquote> Some app makers felt sorry for PHP 5 and decided to create the world&rsquo;s ugliest advocacy site&#8230;</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s bush league, Matt.  Cut the elitism BS and stick to a proper, logically sound argument.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t agree with your arguments, and it&#8217;s almost like you are saying that everyone MUST comply to PHP5 fanboys.</p>

<p>And if you talk about the security features, you still rely on the PHP5 backend, which hardly anyone inspects for flaws. Ever saw the PHP5 security buglist? it&#8217;s almost as large as PHP4 to PHP4.6 combined. More features, more stuff to attack, more unknown and potential holes.</p>

<p>I praise the effort of PHP5 but I don&#8217;t need it, hence I could get away free with using php3 if I wanted and still be secure, cause it still depends on how you handle data as a programmer. No short cuts while relying on the PHP5 backend to solve your problems. It can supplement, but It poses a danger if one trusts upon it blindly.</p>

<p>And the Apache 1.337 =&gt; Apache 2.00 discussion is a wise lesson, newer doesn&#8217;t mean more secure, It maybe easier to do stuff than before, but it isn&#8217;t &#8220;more&#8221; secure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful entry! This is just the kind of thing I was hoping people would post. Just a few notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>We now have parameterized SQL in core.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re not concerned with databases besides MySQL.</li>
<li>We have fine HTML filtering with KSES. The filtering has never been a problem, it&#8217;s just places where it&#8217;s been not applied.</li>
<li>While it would be nice to get a little more performance by using prepared statements, SQL is generally less than 5% of execution time.</li>
<li>OOP - In our experience strict OO can be fairly intimidating to casual coders, who are the people who have created the countless plugins for WP that make it as popular as it is today and, as you note, we&#8217;d like to maintain backward compatibility for. However internal APIs and code has embraced OO methods where appropiate.</li>
</ol>

<p>While significant efforts have been made in auditing WP&#8217;s code, and we will continue to do so, I&#8217;m operating under the assumption that someday someone will find something, so our focus is on notification and ease of upgrading. Since people are using WP as a platform we need to make it upgrade like one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m on the fence with this one.  While I love all the advantages that PHP 5.2 has over PHP 4.4, I can understand Matt&#8217;s argument about the legions of plugin developers who don&#8217;t grok OOP.  However, Josh has some great points about enforcing security by default using PDO, Filter, and other features only available in PHP 5+.</p>

<p>The great thing about open source software is that people who are not happy with the status quo have the freedom to fork the project and go their own way.  There&#8217;s nothing to stop somebody from creating &#8220;wOOrdpress&#8221;.  Get it?  OO?</p>

<p>Would this be a good thing for the Wordpress community as a whole?  Hard to say, but my guess is probably not.  Will the whole GoPHP5 movement really result in a mass upgrade?  I hope so, but I don&#8217;t know that either.  I just know that Wordpress is arguably the most popular and most extensible PHP app in existence today and we should probably think twice before we really rock the boat.</p>

<p>Does something need to be done to finally squelch the lingering code issues that WP has?  Absolutely.  Is a complete rewrite using PHP5-only features the answer we&#8217;re looking for?  Magic 8 Ball says&#8230; &#8220;Ask again later.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just as there are developers who don&#8217;t &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; PHP5 and its OO features, there are other developers who don&#8217;t want to traverse through a procedural mess. I am one of those people. Sure, I would love to extend a few things about my WP installation, but the codebase beneath is simply functions strung together, PHP/HTML intermixed at many different levels.</p>

<p>So because there are hack developers who know little PHP and can work with the procedural mess, that is what keeps you from moving to a cleaner OO system?</p>

<p>I hope as someone else pointed out, that someone will extend it to be OO. For now, I have found the best option is to simply move away from WordPress as it can&#8217;t do the things I need my site to do (without me hacking the procedural mess, no thanks). This doesn&#8217;t make Wordpress bad, I am just on the other side of the fence in that I prefer clean code and standards within.</p>

<p>I think the real issue is that people try to stretch Wordpress into something it isn&#8217;t. Again, nothing against WP - it is a great blogging system. Some people try and make it do things it simply wasn&#8217;t created for.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe I should upgrade and check out the recent changes that Matt listed above before I speak any more.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Um, procedural code isn&#8217;t a bad thing. The WordPress code is very easy to extend and that in my opinion is worth more than anything. I believe more applications should duplicate the plugin (hook, action, event) model of WordPress.</p>

<p>Unless you work with WordPress and other OO applications, you can&#8217;t really appreciate the ease. Also, reading WordPress code is a lot cleaner than some other applications.</p>

<p>Sometime, look at the horror that is Coppermine and you&#8217;ll be impress by that of WordPress. However, the Gallery 2 code is solid.</p>

<p>I actually started an OO fork of WordPress Yesterday, but I&#8217;m not sure how far I&#8217;ll get with it. Probably abandon it after a couple of weeks, after I realize it is a waste of time and WordPress code is good enough Procedural.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@funkatron - WordPress wouldn&#8217;t dominate the blogging software &#8220;market&#8221; if Matt wasn&#8217;t a smart guy. We all know he&#8217;s smart.</p>

<p>Another intelligent man who used his smarts to dominate a market is Bill Gates. However Bill&#8217;s poor coding skills are legendary. The success of Windows is a testament to his marketing skills, not his coding abilities.</p>

<p>The same holds true for Matt. The WordPress code is proof enough that he&#8217;s not the greatest programmer. It breaks dozens of fundamental coding practices &#8212; Poor abstraction, reusability, no inline documentation, etc. If you don&#8217;t even understand and use the fundamentals of programming, how can you say with authority that PHP4 is just fine, and PHP5 has nothing to offer?</p>

<p>So yes, he&#8217;s a smart guy. He&#8217;s been a great marketer. But he&#8217;s no programmer, which is why I couldn&#8217;t care less what he has to say on the subject.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think there&#8217;s a fundamental point being missed here. I&#8217;ve watched Matt work for several years and argued against him on numerous points during that time. While I don&#8217;t always agree with him or his arguments, like most smart people Matt is willing to be convinced by good arguments on the other side.</p>

<p>The real issue that I see is that for many PHP5 is still lacking a &#8220;OMG I have to upgrade right now because I want <em>that</em>&#8221; feature. That will drive upgrades much more than an pro PHP5 campaigns, etc.</p>

<p>You may not agree with Matt&#8217;s opinions on this topic, but I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s the first time you&#8217;ve heard them. Think about that for a little bit. Certainly we can all agree that compelling features make for quicker adoption of upgrades.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Alex - I think this is where we start getting into a cylindrical stale-mate. Web hosts aren&#8217;t looking for &#8220;OMG&#8221; features. They&#8217;re only looking for demand to upgrade.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no demand on web hosts to upgrade when insanely huge, popular applications like WP still work with dusty ol&#8217; PHP 4.3.</p>

<p>Matt isn&#8217;t going to push forward, partially because web hosts still support 4.3, so there&#8217;s no demand for him to leave PHP4 behind.</p>

<p>And around and around we go. Web hosts and application developers are both staring at each other, waiting for the other one to make the first move.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the other reason Matt won&#8217;t leave PHP4 behind? It&#8217;s possibly because he doesn&#8217;t think PHP5 has any &#8220;OMG&#8221; features, and that&#8217;s what funkatron&#8217;s post is all about.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s trying to point out that PHP5 has some serious OMG features that could benefit WP in so many ways. But Matt either doesn&#8217;t understand, or doesn&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>All the code Matt creates (or code written by others that he manages) is written in PHP4 (that I know of), so I have to wonder if he&#8217;s even tried using PHP5 in a serious real world way. You can&#8217;t say you don&#8217;t like something, or say you don&#8217;t see the value of it until you&#8217;ve tried it, right?</p>

<p>True, yes, but&#8230; let&#8217;s look at something matt said in his post:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it that made PHP 4 so successful? What are we doing to emphasize those strengths? Why wasn’t PHP 5 compelling to that same audience? &#8220;</p>

<p>I think a lot of what made PHP4 so successful was simply timing, good integration with Apache, and a shallow learning curve.  All of these things are also present in PHP3.  A couple features in PHP4 aided things a bit, like native sessions (although pure PHP solutions existed, which Matt seems to prefer), but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the case that particular PHP4-only features dramatically increased adoption. PHP4 had a fully rewritten engine, but feature-wise 4 was very much an <em>evolutionary</em> change, just like PHP5 and just like PHP6 seems to be. Things that have been present in <em>all</em> PHP versions since 3 were, imho, what led to PHP&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p>The difference between the jump from 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 is that PHP has a far, far larger audience to deal with, and a MUCH larger group of applications which may have bc issues (although I think those are fairly minor in most cases).  I suspect that is why adoption of PHP5 is slower, and not because of anything inherent to PHP4 that&#8217;s not there in PHP5.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Use or non-use of OOP is unrelated to the garbled mess inside WP (it makes me shudder, too). If anything, bad OOP is significantly harder to follow than bad functional/procedural code, because it adds a full extra dimension of inheritance to the what-the-heck-is-this-program-doing search space.</p>

<p>The other arguments offered in this post boil down saving users from themselves: if we could just force everyone to move to a language version that limited their actions in some crucial way (enforced prepared statements, input filtering), there would be no security problems. Aside from being unrealistic, you deny the ease of use and approach that made PHP4 and WordPress catch on as strongly as they did. This is Matt&#8217;s core point: messiness supports and allows popularity.</p>

&#8230;And that&#8217;s precisely the reason a number of OSS projects formed the GoPHP5 group. To collectively take the first step and get the ball rolling with hosting, application, and other upgrades. It&#8217;s baffled me that some people talk about that move as a &#8216;political move,&#8217; or &#8216;playing power games with users,&#8217; and so on. It&#8217;s all about breaking the stalemate that locks apps out of useful new work that the PHP development team is producing.</p>

<p>Agreed, badly organized code is a challenge to follow, no matter if it&#8217;s procedural or no.  I do tend to find OOP easier to grok out of the box, but that may just be me.</p>

<p>I think you mis-characterize my post, though.  I&#8217;m pointing out features that PHP5 provides which would, I believe, improve Wordpress.  When I do talk about enforcement of certain coding styles, those are things that would be done on a <em>project</em> level. The context is the Wordpress project, not <em>all</em> PHP development.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d have to see a much more fleshed-out argument that &#8220;messiness&#8221; supports and allows popularity on a per-project level.  I do think that PHP&#8217;s popularity owes a lot, not so much to being messy, but to being <em>accessible</em> (maybe we mean the same thing, though).  However, I don&#8217;t think the feature set changes between 3 and 4 were any more significant than from 4 and 5, and I don&#8217;t believe they contributed significantly to PHP&#8217;s rise in popularity.  I&#8217;d certainly like to head arguments to the contrary, though.</p>

<p>I sure applaud the new features, but I also say it isn&#8217;t smart to rely on it solely. I rather would see a very stripped version of PHP, cleaned from all those functions, which all do more or less the same.</p>

<p>I started OO scripting in 2004 and in the end I dropped it because it didn&#8217;t save me any time, and it did not made my apps run any better. No one has ever convinced me of the benefits after that because I still think it&#8217;s a useless concept.</p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth;
My scripting mantra is simple, I don&#8217;t make it anymore complex than it already is.</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;re oversimplifying the issue and underestimating the challenge of dealing with an enormous user base in an open-source project.  Indeed, I&#8217;m not even trying to argue that everyone <em>should</em> be using PHP5 &#8212; I do, and I enjoy many of its features, but anyone can feel free to continue to use PHP4 if they wish.  I simply was addressing the idea that PHP5 had little to offer Wordpress &#8212; I don&#8217;t feel that&#8217;s true, and made a post about that. You&#8217;re inferring things that aren&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
If PHP5 were so compelling people would be using it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>Lots of PHP developers would <em>love</em> to use PHP5 exclusively. I talk to them all the time. And many that do start using PHP5 never want to go back to PHP4.</p>

<p>But they can&#8217;t use PHP5 because it&#8217;s still not wildly supported among web hosts. If you want wide adoption of your application, you need to write it for PHP4, because many web hosts still aren&#8217;t using PHP5 yet.</p>

<p>The features <em>are</em> there, and developers <em>do want</em> to use them. I disagree fully with your point, and agree with funkatron by saying you&#8217;re oversimplifying the issue.</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#8217;d use PHP5 for SimpleXML alone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m with Sean on this one - the problem for the vast majority of developers out there isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t want to move to PHP5, it is that they <em>cannot</em> because their host doesn&#8217;t support it.</p>

<p>When the PHP developers broke all chance web hosts had of making a painless upgrade from 4 to 5, they broke with it all chance of quick adoption. Sadly I believe ultimately the blame must lay with them and no-one else. It was an internals design decision that caused this mess beyond anything else.</p>

<p>If they do the same from PHP 5 to 6 then quite frankly most of us can kiss our beloved language goodbye within a very short period of time (which, as a full-time professional PHP developer, scares me greatly).</p>

<p>Yep, in larger projects with multiple programmers OOP is a blessing. That is quite true. But like above stated, a new OOP vs Procedure war is a bit too much and I won&#8217;t join it. ^^</p>

<p>If any, my point was actually that PHP5 doesn&#8217;t make it anymore secure persee, it&#8217;s not like: I install PHP5 and I&#8217;m safe. That is giving developers the wrong example.</p>

<p>Most PHP scripters think they are safe, I guess it&#8217;s a good start by changing attitudes of PHP scripters by convincing them it&#8217;s okay to upgrade to PHP5, but it doesn&#8217;t mean you back sit back and relax now.</p>

<p>Sarcasm aside I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s as simple as that. In order to offer both flavours you have to have one of them running as CGI, or split them out across different servers, both of which are quite messy solutions. If you host a number of high traffic PHP 4 sites and then swap them all to the CGI vrsion just so you can get PHP 5 on there, you are going to notice the hit on your servers.</p>

<p>If you are a decently sized host then you replicate this across thousands of servers, it is no trivial matter.</p>

<p>If PHP 6 will not work with PHP 5 (which I highly suspect) then web hosts are shit-out of luck - at the moment they can at least juggle 4 and 5 via CGI and Module, but which one gets the elbow when 6 comes along?</p>

<p>FWIW, I have generally been happy with Dreamhost, and despite the fact that they&#8217;ve had some pretty dramatic issues over the last year, I think that they do a lot comparatively to provide a more secure PHP environment than most large hosts in their cost range.</p>

<p>I do think that the PHP group would be well-advised to consult a lot more with large web hosting teams on issues like the ones you&#8217;ve highlighted.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It comes as no surprise to me that WordPress isn&#8217;t interested in these modern coding techniques, after seeing - in only one of many examples - the revision process to the Widget plugin, which is now just a shadow of its formerly entirely OO self.  It&#8217;s simultaneously ironic that they&#8217;re convinced that they&#8217;re user-centered in design when the contributing developers (core and plugin) that made the product popular are the users they&#8217;re alienating by dragging their feet with their dedication to PHP4.  WordPress, for reasons I haven&#8217;t been able to understand, has the power to affect positive change, but doesn&#8217;t bother.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in a PHP5-based, object-oriented project - to follow through on matt&#8217;s brazen yet tired refrain of &#8220;if you think you can do better&#8221; - please check out &lt;a href=&#8221;http://habariproject.org&#8221;&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt; where we&#8217;ve got a bunch of developers (including many prior WP contributors) working within a truly open-source contribution model where contributor opinion on the technology used actually factors into the decision-making.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m totally pumped about this weekends&#8217; <a href="http://www.vintage.org/2007/midwest/">Vintage Computer Festival Midwest 3.0</a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>.  It&#8217;s only $5 to get in and free for kids under 17.  Some registered exhibits that sound cool include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Geek Museum Collection:</strong>
&#8220;Sampling of the Geek Museum&#8217;s mobile collection focusing on a wide range of general consumer electronics computing history will be displayed with demos. Great for kids!&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commodore Plus/4:</strong>
&#8220;The Commodore Plus/4 was a home computer released by Commodore International in 1984. Commodore billed the Plus/4 as the first home computer designed especially for productivity applications. The Plus/4 included a ROM based integrated software package containing word processing, spreadsheet, database, and graphing applications.&#8221;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m something of a collector of old hardware myself, especially game consoles and home computers.  My current collections includes, off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Magnavox Odyssey</li>
<li>Commodore 64 + 1541 Floppy Drive</li>
<li>Atari 7800</li>
<li>NES x2</li>
<li>Amiga 600</li>
<li>SuperNES</li>
<li>TurboGrafx-16</li>
<li>Sega Genesis + 32X + Sega CD</li>
<li>Atari Jaguar</li>
<li>Sega Saturn</li>
<li>Sony Playstation</li>
<li>Gameboy Color</li>
<li>Sega Dreamcast</li>
<li>Sony Playstation 2</li>
<li>Microsoft XBox</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
</ul>

<p>And I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m forgetting some stuff (I think I have a 128k Mac, but I honestly am not sure).  That&#8217;s just the hardware; I have hundreds of games crossing all of those systems.  I need to dig through that stuff sometime and catalog it.</p>

<p><img src="http://funkatron.com/images/uploads/spazAIR.png" alt="spazAIR.png" border="0" width="124" height="147" align="right" />So I&#8217;m basically rewriting <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> as an <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">AIR</a> app.  You get a ton of wins with AIR, the biggest for me being the ability to leverage my web skillz to write a desktop app.  Some folks may not realize that <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/develop_ajax.html">AIR allows you to write apps in pure HTML+JS</a> &#8212; no Flash, no Flex.  This is a Big Win for me, and a lot of other folks, I think.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using to write Spaz.AIR:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dreamweaver (although you really don&#8217;t need to &#8212; it just makes packaging the app a bit easier)</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry JS Framework, v1.5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a></li>
<li>Plain old HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I recorded a <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/spaz/AIR/spaz.AIR-earlyAlpha.mp4">screencast</a> of a <em>very</em> early alpha version of Spaz.AIR.  <strike>The file is <strong>big</strong>, because I wanted high quality but also something my poor 12&#8221; Powerbook could actually handle recording</strike> I was having trouble with playback on Windows, so I converted the file to mp4 via Quicktime Pro.  Now it&#8217;s 9MB instead of 290MB, and looks almost identical.</p>

<p>Through an apparent clerical error, I&#8217;ve been chosen to speak at <a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/p/index" title="Harness the Power of PHP, or something">php|works Atlanta</a> on September 12-13.  I&#8217;ll be speaking on <a href="http://PhpSecInfo.com" title="PhpSecInfo provides an equivalent to the phpinfo() function that reports security information about the PHP environment, and offers suggestions for improvement.">PHPSecInfo</a>, the PHP environment security auditing tool.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed php|tek Chicago this May, which was my first <a href="http://www.phparch.com/" title="Write something about mayonaise and PHP here">PHP Architect</a> conference, and I trust this one will be just as cool, with talks from folks like <a href="http://benramsey.com/" title="I'm jealous of him because he has way more feed subscribers than me">Ben Ramsey</a>, <a href="http://eliw.com/" title="Note: lay off the Digg jokes">Eli White</a>, <a href="http://shiflett.org/" title="Try not to be sick this time">Chris Shiflett</a>, and <a href="http://www.terrychay.com/blog/" title="Mothafuckin'">Terry Chay</a>.  Terry and I will also be competing in the first annual PHP offend-off, where we see who can most efficiently insult the sensibilities of a room full of attendees.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been father south than D.C., so I&#8217;m interested to see what the land of Andre 3000 is like.</p>

This adds a 2-minute auto refresh of the currently displayed timeline, and fixes a high CPU usage bug. Unfortunately, this latter is also a bit of a regression, as the cause of the high CPU usage helped Spaz handle loading and painting userpics more quickly. Hopefully I can improve this in later releases.</p>

<p>Speaking of later releases, I&#8217;m giving serious consideration to rewriting Spaz using the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe Integrated Runtime</a> (AIR, previously Apollo). There&#8217;s a great deal of appeal in utilizing web development and design skills to create desktop apps. <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Adobe&#8217;s Spry javascript framework</a> has <em>excellent</em> data handling tools, beyond what most other JS frameworks offer: you can use arbitrary XML, JSON, or even HTML as a data source.  Combining that with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/AIR:Dreamweaver_CS3_Extension">Dreamweaver AIR extension</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/spry/">DW CS3 Spry integration</a>, and there is some real power to rapidly develop RIAs without having to learn new tools and languages.</p>

<li>added new right-click/ctrl+click menus on messages.</li>
<li>changed double-click action: starts reply to user, unless double-clicking
on a direct message, in which case it starts a dm.</li>
<li>Fixed/added direct message reading</li>
<li>Added &#8220;replies&#8221; support</li>
<li>Added &#8220;featured&#8221; support</li>
<li>Increased depth of message boxes to handle larger sizes</li>
<li>Switched to multiline output of statuses.  All statuses should now be

<p>I&#8217;ve once again tricked people into putting me on their podcast.

<p>David Maynor, previously known for <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/007454.html" title="the disastrous clown car known as the Apple Wifi Hack">the disastrous clown car known as the Apple Wifi Hack</a>, posted some info on <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2007/06/niiiice.html" title="Niiiice">exploits he&#8217;s discovered in the new Safari beta</a>.  This is a bit disappointing, but not altogether surprising, considering it&#8217;s, ya know, beta software.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more disappointing is this &#8220;I don&#8217;t like Company A, so being irresponsible is kosher&#8221; kind of thinking that Maynor exhibits:</p>

<blockquote>Keeping with our disclosure policy, we do not report bugs to Apple.</blockquote>

<p>And further down:</p>

<blockquote>&#8230; in most cases we will give vendors as long as they need to fix problems. If the vendor is unresponsive or make threats, we will give them 30 days then release details. If a vendor answers a vulnerability disclosure with marketing and spin attempts, we no longer report vulnerabilities to that vendor but the information goes into our Hacker Eye View program for customers and will be used in pentesting.</blockquote>

<p>So if you happen to use a product that is made by a company Mr. Maynor decides he doesn&#8217;t like, he won&#8217;t tell you what the problem is or how to fix it.  Unless you pay him.  But you will get vague descriptions of the exploit in his official Blogger site.</p>

<p>Two things are problematic with this.  First, the fact that Maynor even <em>has</em> a policy like this, one that is so obviously open to abuse via personal preference and emotion.  There are bigger things to consider than hurt feelings when dealing with vulnerabilities, like <strong>the safety of the people using the exploitable product</strong>.  Anyone who decides to take on the role of a security &#8220;expert&#8221; or &#8220;adviser&#8221; needs to understand that and act accordingly.  If they can&#8217;t, they need to find a new line of work.</p>

<p>Secondly, the caveat that Maynor is willing to release this info for a price.  I won&#8217;t make the argument that <em>no</em> exploit information should ever be anything but free &#8212; I haven&#8217;t thought that one out enough &#8212; but I do think it is wrong to only release exploit information about a free, widely distributed, consumer-level application to folks who have paid the toll.  This is, I believe, a matter of public safety, and treating it like some kind of mercenary mission demonstrates a disappointing lack of regard towards those who will be most affected by these exploits: the users.</p>

<p>All of us who do work in security need to do a gut check, and make sure we&#8217;re doing this for the right reasons.  The public good needs to be placed before our greed and our egos.</p>

<p>The use of the word, “public good” is very apropos. Unfortunately, free market systems (driven by greed and immune to egos) are not good at pricing “public goods” (e.g. fire, police, national security, roads, airwaves, libraries, schools) in an efficient manner—instead the good is drastically underproduced.</p>

<p>When you see thinly veiled extortion attempts, it is a natural outcome from an attitude that doesn’t realize that there are limits to rampant capitalism.</p>

<p>Once you cross the line between objective analysis, and zealotry, it&#8217;s hard for people to take you seriously, unfortunately.. this also marks the steady decline of your influence, and an increase in your flamebait posts.</p>

<p>Good post Ed.</p>

<p><strong>Update: This is fixed in <a href="http://www.yazsoft.com/" title="Yazsoft">Speed Download 4.1.12</a></strong></p>

<p><strike>Suckers</strike> Early adopters like me have already downloaded the Safari 3.0 beta, because it pays to be super cool like us.  However, it&#8217;s hard to be awesome when your browser crashes on startup, like mine was.  It looks like the Speed Download plugin I had installed was at fault.</p>

<p>To remove it, I went to <code>&lt;My Home Directory&gt;/Library/InputManagers/</code> and trashed the <code>SpeedDownload Enhancer</code> folder. Now Safari 3.0 starts nicely.</p>

<p>Although downloads have been on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/">the Google Code site</a> for a bit, I recently put up <a href="http://inspekt.googlecode.com/files/inspekt-20070531.zip">a new build of Inspekt</a>.  This could probably be described as a late alpha release, with most <a href="http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/wiki/OWASPProposal">proposed features</a> implemented.  Full API docs are included in the download.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://inspekt.googlecode.com/files/inspekt-20070531.zip">http://inspekt.googlecode.com/files/inspekt-20070531.zip</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve written up <a href="http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/wiki/BasicUsage">a bit of documentation on the basics of Inspekt</a>, with example code showing off some of the currently-implemented features:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/wiki/BasicUsage">http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/wiki/BasicUsage</a></li>

<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/source">http://code.google.com/p/inspekt/source</a></li>

<p>I&#8217;m very, very excited to announce that <a href="http://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a> has <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-all/2007-May/000039.html">chosen to fund development</a> of what I&#8217;m calling &#8220;<strong>Inspekt</strong>&#8221; as part of their <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007">OWASP Spring of Code 2007</a>.  You can read my full proposal at the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007_Applications#EdFinkler_-_A_comprehensive_input_retrieval.2Ffiltering_system_for_PHP">OWASP SoC Application Page</a></p>

<p>The idea behind Inspekt is to provide a comprehensive input filtering and validation library for PHP.  Building upon Chris Shiflett&#8217;s original Zend_Filter_Input implementation, the primary <em>new</em> features will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide retrieval and filtering support for multidimensional arrays</li>
<li>Provide solutions for scoping issues (avoid the need for &#8220;global&#8221; keywords everywhere)</li>
<li>A variety of helper methods to reduce code verbosity</li>
<li>Block deprecated HTTP_*_VARS and other ways to grab input data without filtering</li>
<li>Auto-restrictions on input defined programatically or via configuration files</li>
<li>Compatible with PHP4 and PHP5</li>
<li>Self contained; not reliant on external libraries</li>
<li>Able to work with a wide variety of frameworks and app architectures; easily &#8220;pluggable&#8221; into any given web app</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m not sure where exactly the project will be hosted during development.  I want to at least have a browsable SVN repo, and some kind of mailing list.  I&#8217;m in the middle of php|tek 2007 right now, but I expect this weeked I can sort more of the details out.  I only have about two months to do this, so I need to get started!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent some of my down time in the past couple weeks working with the <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov">NIST NVD</a> data to get stats on PHP application vulnerabilities.  What follows is a breakdown of the 20 PHP-based applications that had the highest aggregate vulnerability scores (NIST assigns a score from 1-10 for the severity of each entry), and the highest total number of vulnerabilities, over the past 12 months.  Of the two, I feel that the aggregate score is a better indicator of security issues.</p>

<p>A few caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data here covers the period between April 1 2006 and April 1 2007.</li>
<li>This obviously only includes <strong>reported</strong> vulnerabilities.  There are surely a lot more applications that are very insecure, but for one reason or another haven&#8217;t had as many reports.</li>
<li>I chose 20 as the cutoff mainly for the sake of making the data a little easier to swallow (and chart nicely). There are about 1,800 distinct apps in the NIST NVD that are (as far as I could determine) PHP-based.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, here are the tepid Excel charts:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.funkatron.com/wp-content/php-top20-april-score.png"><img src="http://blog.funkatron.com/wp-content/_php-top20-april-score.png" alt="Nist NVD Data - April 1 2006 to April 1 2007 - PHP Apps by Score Count" title="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.funkatron.com/wp-content/php-top20-april-entries.png"><img src="http://blog.funkatron.com/wp-content/_php-top20-april-entries.png" alt="Nist NVD Data - April 1 2006 to April 1 2007 - PHP Apps by Entry Count" title="" /></a></p>

<p>A couple notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 25 entries in the top &#8220;20&#8221; by vulnerability count, due to matching vulnerability counts.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d never even <strong>heard</strong> of <a href="http://www.mybboard.net/">MyBulletinBoard</a>, the top entry in both lists.  It hasn&#8217;t had any vulnerabilities in the NVD since September of 2006, which says something about how numerous and severe the entries between April and September 2006 were.  This appears to be the same product as &#8220;MyBB,&#8221; so perhaps the situation has improved, as MyBB only has one NVD entry in the entire period (<a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-0544">CVE-2007-0544</a>).</li>
<li>Wordpress has had a bad start to 2007, with numerous vulnerabilities that significantly increased its ranking.  March 2007 was particularly bad, with 7 new vulnerabilities reported.</li>
<li>Bulletin board/forum software is by far the most common type of application in the top 20.  A couple forum apps that have very <strong>low</strong> numbers of vulnerability reports: <a href="http://getvanilla.com/">Vanilla</a> and <a href="http://fudforum.org/">FUDForum</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do intend to keep this data up-to-date if people find it interesting, so let me know if you&#8217;d like me to do so, or if you&#8217;d like to see other types of analysis.</p>

<p>So about a month and a half ago I turned on the ancient water softener in our basement, because we had tons of calcium deposits on our dishes.  I believe I had run it for a while when we first moved in, but gave after a bit because I thought it wasn&#8217;t worth the trouble of handling the salt and such.<br /><br />This morning, a guy from the water dept came to my door.  He was checking to see if the meter was messed up, or if we had a leak.<br /><br />Uh-oh.<br /><br />I turned off the softener.  The meter stopped spinning.  That was &#8220;the leak.&#8221;  I guess it just never shut itself off, so it was constantly running water through itself.  I actually noticed it seemed to run a lot, but I&#8217;m a total novice with this shit, and assumed it was okay.<br /><br />So I called the utility office, because I was concerned about what the bill might be.  For good reason.<br /><br />Apparently, in the month of march, we had used 115,000 gallons of water.<br /><br />That will be <strong>$683</strong>, please.<br /><br />And of course, since I didn&#8217;t turn it off until the middle of march, I&#8217;d expect another half that much to get tacked on for April.  That should kick us up over $1000.<br /><br />Coulda bought a new softener for that, and done other improvements we need.<br /><br />They&#8217;ll spread it over 6 months, which is nice.  I <em>could</em> pay it all now, but it wouldn&#8217;t be easy.<br /><br />I know, I know, it&#8217;s just money, but&#8230; dammit.  I was hoping we were getting ahead.  And now something stupid I did cost us a whole chunk of change.<br /><br /><em>frown</em></p>

<blockquote>According to <a href="http://video.msn.com/v/us/fv/money/fv.htm??g=0a730c1b-b4ab-4f5e-bdeb-141b9174a6c8&amp;t=&amp;f=15/64yourrealtaxrate40&amp;p=&amp;fg=">this Kiplinger&#8217;s tax tip video</a>, only 1 in 150 personal tax returns get audited. Realistically speaking, your odds of getting audited are probably even lower than that. In fact, it&#8217;s virtually zero.<br /><br />The Kiplinger editor calls the taxpayer&#8217;s fear of audits &#8216;very stupid.&#8217; He explains that you will not get audited as long as you don&#8217;t claim any insane tax deductions. Therefore, everyone should be aggressive and take advantage of all the available deductions within reason.<br /><br /><b>Our irrational fear of audits</b><br /><br />One recent survey conducted by a CPA at Louisiana State University shows that the average taxpayers believe 1 in 7 people gets audited by the IRS. Over 80% of the people surveyed had unrealistically high expectations of getting audited.<br /><br />When the survey takes into consideration the likely income bracket of the participants, the results get even more ridiculous:<br /></blockquote>

<p>Since last post was a good Myspace trashing, I thought I&#8217;d mention a social network site I&#8217;ve been digging: <a href="http://virb.com">Virb</a>. Here&#8217;s why I like it:</p>

<ul>

    <li>It&#8217;s pretty and clean. You&#8217;re not overwhelmed with information. It&#8217;s *pleasant* to look at Virb.</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s easy to make basic changes to your profile, and you have full CSS control if you want or need it. I haven&#8217;t come across a site that handled &#8220;themeing&#8221; as well as Virb.</li>

    <li>Virb clearly thought about how to organize your stuff, and it does a good job of letting you do so in an easy and logical manner</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s easy to add new modules to your profile that can include more advanced html and embedded media. Where your media can come from is whitelisted, which means <strong>better security</strong>; there&#8217;s much less chance of having your profile hijacked just by viewing someone else&#8217;s page</li>
    <li>Embedding Flickr photos is SO easy. Since I use Flickr for everything, it&#8217;s totally awesome.</li>

    <li>If you&#8217;re into music, Virb does a good job of letting you check out tunes, add bands, keep track of their shows, and the like *without* all the shittiness of Myspace</li>

    <li>It&#8217;s not flooded with ads and doesn&#8217;t make you log-in and &#8216;start over&#8217; unnecessarily</li>

</ul>

<p>So what don&#8217;t I like about Virb so much?</p>

<ul>
    <li>I really really wish I could import data into my profile via RSS. I already have 3 blogs (counting my work blog) &#8212; I have no interest in maintaining another. If I could just have my blog entries imported into my Virb blog, it&#8217;d be perfect. (<strong>update:</strong> Virb has blog importing via RSS <a href="http://virb.com/is/new_features">listed as &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221;</a>)</li>

    <li>Worse, no RSS feeds for my Virb blog! This is a big missing piece, and I&#8217;m really surprised they don&#8217;t have this yet. This bad boy should be filled with subscribable (is that a word?) data so you can track your friends, your bands&#8217; shows, and the like.</li>
</ul>

<p>So consider this an invitation:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a href="http://virb.com/funkatron">My personal Virb profile</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://virb.com/cultofjester">Cult of Jester&#8217;s Virb profile</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I’m trying Virb to see if it is everything people say it is.</p>

<p>I loaded my pictures which wasn’t oo hard. I added my first blog entry - simple and Now I’m moving into more detailed stuff. I hope it beats MySpace - sick of webcam girl and It’s ok to look ads.</p>

<p>Marcys Whitney thinks <a href="http://www.marcuswhitney.com/2007/04/10/myspace-sucks-as-a-social-tool/">MySpace Sucks as a Social Tool</a>:<br /></p>

<blockquote>So, I think MySpace sucks.  It sucks because it has absolutely no technically social qualities outside of itself aside from RSS and email, both of which are very limited and poorly implemented.  Wordpress on the other hand is an example of the Internet as an operation system environment.  Do you think it sucks?  If so why, if not… I don’t think I care.<br /><br />It is a great user generated content web destination however.   So kudos to them for at least succeeding there</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />It&#8217;s very insular, indeed, which is why I&#8217;ve pretty much given up on it.  Plus the extremely obvious attempts to pump up ad view stats with crap like:<br /><br />- Letting me view some of a person&#8217;s profile while not logged-in<br />- Forcing me to log-in when I want to view, say, pictures<br />- Not returning me to where I was before I logged in, but forcing me to AGAIN navigate back to the person&#8217;s profile.<br /><br />Beyond lame.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Company</strong> Warner Bros. Records
<strong>Location</strong> Burbank, CA
<strong>Title</strong> PHP Developer
<strong>Summary </strong>
Warner Brothers Records is looking for a freelance PHP developer skilled in Drupal themeing and programming. To be considered you must be able to work at our office, <strong><em>provide your own computer</em></strong> and be very comfortable developing using SVN.

You&#8217;ll be in New Media, a very relaxed work environment, with cool and quirky people. We prize Mac users but welcome all. This is a great chance to work with bands like Arctic Monkeys, White Stripes, Damien Rice, Muse and more.

To apply please send an e-mail with the following to nmtech@warnerbrosrecords.com:

<ul>
<li>PHP Developer and your full name in the Subject line.</li>
<li>3 Links to actual code you have written and or sites worked on what you worked on.</li>
<li>Tell us a little about yourself and send a link to your blog you have one.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>Lemme get this straight: I have to work at your office, but <em>provide my own computer???</em>  This reads like a really slimy way of getting people to work cheap in exchange for <em>maybe</em> doing a web site for some half-wit modern &#8220;rock&#8221; band.  I&#8217;ll keep my iMac at home and make more money doing contracting work, but thanks all the same, WB.</p>

<p><a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PhpSecInfo</a> v0.2.1 is now available.  It&#8217;s primarily a bugfix release, but a fairly significant one.  From the <a href="http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>uid and gid tests now correctly test the user and group that PHP is executing as (requires that <code>exec()</code> or <a href="http://us.php.net/posix">posix functions</a> are enabled)</li>
<li>Changed upload_max_filesize and post_max_size return &#8220;OK&#8221; if current value is equal to recommended value</li>
<li>fixed nonstandard naming with a couple locally used constants</li>
<li>fixed problem with XHTML validity in cases of not run tests (thanks Thomas Corbiere)</li>

I got the standard rejection letter for my talk proposal on <a href="http://PhpSecInfo.com/">PHPSecInfo</a>.  It&#8217;s kind of frustrating, not just because this means there&#8217;s no way I can go (I can&#8217;t afford to send myself, and it&#8217;s not in the work budget), but because there&#8217;s no feedback given at all.  I understand why they don&#8217;t, but I wish I knew more about why I didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t see this until today, since it went out the PostgreSQL newsletter which goes to my work account, but I thought it was pretty funny for an April Fool&#8217;s gag:</p>

<blockquote>
PostgreSQL 10.0, now called PREGRES, was released today.  Some new features include:
[&#8230;]
- A new table type: PgISAM.  Rather than using the cumbersome and complicated MVCC model, it simply acquires global database locks on read and write.  &#8220;It took ten years to create a benchmark that would make this one look good,&#8221; said Peter Eisentraut, in explanation for the delay. </blockquote>

<p>After pounding for a few hours, I think I finally got the UID and GID tests for <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> in an acceptable state.  Two things have made this hard:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can really only do this with an exec() call to the &#8220;id&#8221; UNIX command, or the posix_* functions, either of which are frequently disabled</li>
<li>There basically is not a foolproof way to programatically tell if a function is available or not in PHP</li>
</ol>

<h1>2 is the real rub, and quite annoying.  <code>is_callable()</code> will return TRUE even if a function has been disabled in php.ini with <code>disabled_functions</code> (which, in my mind, is contrary to what &#8220;is_callable&#8221; implies).  <code>function_exists()</code> will return FALSE if the function is disabled in php.ini, but will return TRUE if the function is being blocked by <code>safe_mode</code>.</h1>

<p>For now, the tests try <code>exec('id')</code> first, seeing if it passes <code>function_exists()</code> <i>and</i> <code>safe_mode</code> is disabled.  If it fails those, the <code>posix_*</code> functions are checked against <code>function_exists</code> (they aren&#8217;t affected by <code>safe_mode</code>.  If those fail as well, the test will be skipped.</p>

<p>I was really, really interested in <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">this article from New York Magazine</a> about how different forms of &#8220;praise&#8221; children receive can dramatically effect how well they are able to perform in school.<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Scholars from Reed College and Stanford reviewed over 150 praise studies. Their meta-analysis determined that praised students become risk-averse and lack perceived autonomy. The scholars found consistent correlations between a liberal use of praise and students’ “shorter task persistence, more eye-checking with the teacher, and inflected speech such that answers have the intonation of questions.”<br /><br />Dweck’s research on overpraised kids strongly suggests that image maintenance becomes their primary concern—they are more competitive and more interested in tearing others down. A raft of very alarming studies illustrate this.<br /><br />In one, students are given two puzzle tests. Between the first and the second, they are offered a choice between learning a new puzzle strategy for the second test or finding out how they did compared with other students on the first test: They have only enough time to do one or the other. Students praised for intelligence choose to find out their class rank, rather than use the time to prepare.<br /><br />In another, students get a do-it-yourself report card and are told these forms will be mailed to students at another school—they’ll never meet these students and don’t know their names. Of the kids praised for their intelligence, 40 percent lie, inflating their scores. Of the kids praised for effort, few lie.<br /><br />When students transition into junior high, some who’d done well in elementary school inevitably struggle in the larger and more demanding environment. Those who equated their earlier success with their innate ability surmise they’ve been dumb all along. Their grades never recover because the likely key to their recovery—increasing effort—they view as just further proof of their failure. In interviews many confess they would “seriously consider cheating.”</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />This is scarily consistent with my own experience as a kid who was constantly told I was smart and special throughout elementary school.  Throughout this period, I basically got by without having to work very hard.  This changed in junior high, and my grades took a nosedive.  To this day I have serious trouble doing things that don&#8217;t give me some kind of &#8220;reward&#8221; quickly, and this is very frustrating to me.</p>

My grades dropped, I felt incredibly stupid, and frustrated with the constant struggle to prove myself.  To this day I want that reward, or praise, or instant recognition.  As for competitiveness, heh.  I still need to crush opposition so I can say, &#8220;I have a High IQ and I am Smarter Than You.

<p>I posted this rather lengthy argument in the <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Zend-Core-f16191.html">Zend fw-core mailing list</a> after I learned that the <code>Zend_Filter_Input</code> component had been dropped from the Zend Framework.  I have used this component extensively in various projects, and had written up a contribution to the <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">Zend DevZone</a> that described using a bootstrap script to block direct access by your developers to the superglobal user input arrays ($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, etc).</p>

<p>I want to be clear that I think the ZFW project leads have done a very good job of guiding the development of the framework.  I think they&#8217;re very smart, capable folks who have done a ton of good, hard work.  I just disagree strongly with what&#8217;s happened to the input filtering components, and feel that it should be addressed before the 1.0 release.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let me start off with some context.  If we do a search for &#8216;php&#8217; in the 2006 records of the <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">NIST NVD</a>, over <em>40%</em> of the total number of vulnerabilities are returned.  Removing language level issues, which would account for a small number of these, we&#8217;re left with an enormous number of PHP application vulnerabilities &#8212; well over 1/3 of all the 2006 entries in the NVD, for sure.</p>

<p>I believe those numbers say a lot about the following things:
1. How popular PHP is
2. How much web applications are a target
3. How many PHP devs are incapable of writing secure applications</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily fault PHP as a language for this, as I think any language of similar ease and popularity would suffer many of the same problems.  And as more and more of our business and social activity is conducted online, web applications are inevitably going to increasingly be targeted.</p>

<p>But we can do a <em>lot</em> about #3, in two major areas: <strong>education</strong>, and <strong>empowerment</strong>.</p>

<p>Education is fairly easy to understand, I think: books, training courses, articles, tutorials, etc.  In a sense, the ZFW project has a significant opportunity to educate PHP developers by serving as an example to the community.  Zend&#8217;s profile in the community gives it an opportunity to raise the bar, and change expectations about what effective, secure web app development entails.</p>

<p>Empowering developers, in my mind, means making it easier to do the right thing.  Our toolsets &#8212; editors, debuggers, frameworks, etc &#8212; should make it <em>easier</em> to write secure applications.  The default action should be the secure action.  It shouldn&#8217;t be <em>impossible</em> to do potentially dangerous stuff, but it should require clear intent on the part of the developer.</p>

<p>This is where I feel the Zend Framework has <strong>regressed</strong> as of version 0.8.  Out of the box, it is <strong>more difficult</strong> to write secure applications with ZFW as of 0.8.0 than it was in 0.7.0.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at stripping tags from user input.  In 0.7:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require "Zend/Filter.php";
$searchtxt = Zend_Filter::noTags($searchtxt);
</pre>

<p>In 0.8:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require "Zend/Filter/StripTags.php";
$noTags    = new Zend_Filter_StripTags();
$searchtxt = $noTags->filter($searchtxt);
</pre>

<p>Only one extra line, but when you&#8217;re having to instantiate a new filter every time you want different functionality, it adds up.  And if you&#8217;re not using class autoloading, you have to do a require statement for every filter class, whereas in 0.7 you only needed to do a single require.</p>

<p>In some ways, the new Zend_Filter is a win, especially in terms of expandability, but it lacks the proper hooks for making filtering and validation as speedy and easy as it was before.  Make no mistake: verbosity <em>matters</em>.  I am not alone in preferring an option that makes me type less.</p>

<p>More disturbing, though, is the total removal of the <strong>Zend_Filter_Input</strong> component from the ZFW.  ZFI was a very effective tool for limiting access to user input arrays like $_POST and $_COOKIE, wrapping them in an object and forcing the developer to use object methods to access the data.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require "Zend/Filter/Input.php";
$f_POST = new Zend_Filter_Input($_POST);
$searchtext = $f_POST->noTags('searchtxt');
$id = $f_POST->getInt('id');

// you can only get the raw input with the getRaw method
$unfiltered_input = $f_POST->getRaw('xssWaitingToHappen');
</pre>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t perfect &#8212; as of 0.7 it lacked iterative access and didn&#8217;t work well with multidimensional arrays &#8212; but it established a strong new paradigm for PHP development that was a long time in coming.  The vast majority of vulnerabilities in PHP apps come from mishandling user input, and Zend_Filter_Input made it significantly <strong>easier to do the right thing</strong>, and significantly <strong>harder to do the wrong thing</strong>.  This was a <em>major</em> jewel for the Zend Framework, something no other high-profile PHP framework was offering (AFAIK).  And it evidently had been considered a fundamental component, having been present in the core since the initial public release (0.1.2).  Now, it&#8217;s gone, with no comparable functionality in place, and no concrete plans to restore it.</p>

<p>Zend has a significant opportunity to influence how PHP development is done with the ZFW 1.0 release.  The Zend Framework will be, for better or worse, considered an example as to how PHP development <em>should</em> be done.  It&#8217;s disappointing, then, to see the framework move backwards in terms of easing secure development while it speeds towards 1.0.  This opportunity will not come again.  I hope these decisions are reconsidered, and the feature freeze is delayed so that previously-existing functionality can be restored.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was concerned myself a lot about all those things: i made a tutorials site which is supposed to be already used by lot of people according to emails i am receiving&#8230;</p>

<p>Also, started a dedicated Zend Framework forum (www.zfforums.com), aso&#8230; More interesting things coming soon&#8230;</p>

<p>Also, as stated into my forum post from here:
http://www.zfforums.com/zend-framework-general-discussions-1/concepts-ideas-planning-39/zend-framework-performance-27.html</p>

<p>One of the biggest improvements i said (and performance costs are not a problem at all for this) are exactly that applications would be more secure using ZF.</p>

<p>IMHO PHP is now surviving only due to large scale of existing developers rather than things as security, rapid development, aso&#8230; I worked with a lot of other platforms (not necessary web oriented) so i think i know what i am talking bout&#8230; So, without a major enhancement - as ZF can be i am said to say but we going to be repeated same mistakes for each newbie developer, same problems unsolved by language itself by lot of time&#8230;</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a thought about a different approach to searching a content-thick web site, or relating a variety of content types to one another, based on my messing around more with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE</a>:</p>

<p>What about using something like <a href="http://beagle-project.org">Beagle</a>, <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> and <a href="http://rlove.org/log/2006070601">BeagleFS</a> to create a search engine of static content and related data?  This might be a little heavy because you&#8217;d basically have to create a new filesystem for each different query, but it would only get that hit the first time it&#8217;s created.  If that&#8217;s too much, though, maybe a PHP/Python/Ruby library to act as a query client against a Beagle database would be adequate.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a> we have a ton of static content (lots of PDFs, a huge FTP site full of source code and message archives and OS mirrors, etc.).  Something like this could really help get a handle on this, both in relating disparate types of data to one another, and in finding the right content in this mass of files.</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>

All of this came about when the duo realized that their attempts at an interview needed to be taken from a different angle. They began to investigate his filmmaking process, which of course, brought up the questions of his practices. I think Melnyk really describes the man best: &#8216;We&#8217;re a bit disappointed and disillusioned with Michael, but we are still very grateful to him for putting documentaries out there in a major way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I just checked in a bunch of bug fixes that get the security module of Zend_Environment working properly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/picture-1.png" rel="lightbox" title="Zend_Environment's Security Module"><img src="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/picture-1.thumbnail.png" width="350" height="262" alt="Zend_Environment's Security Module" class="imageframe" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" /></a></p>

<p>If you want to try it yourself, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Subversion+Standards">Check out the latest Zend Framework from SVN</a></li>
 <li>Add the <code>library</code> <em>and</em> <code>incubator/library</code> directories from the SVN checkout to your include path</li>
 <li>Do some code-foo like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">require 'Zend.php';
function __autoload($class) {
    Zend::loadClass($class);
}

$sec = new Zend_Environment_Module_Security('sec');
$ze = new Zend_Environment(array($sec));
echo $ze->toHtml();</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more you can do with the Zend_Environment package that&#8217;s all due to Simon Mundy&#8217;s kickass work (more modules, you can iterate over results, query for settings, etc).  I&#8217;ll try to cover some other usage scenarios in upcoming posts.</p>

<p>I just posted this to the <a href="http://lists.phpsec.org/mailman/listinfo/phpsecinfo">phpsecinfo mailing list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Folks who download today&#8217;s <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> 0.8 release will notice the a new library in the &#8220;incubator&#8221; section: <a href="http://www.peptolab.com/">Simon Mundy</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/incubator/Zend_Environment/Zend_Environment.html">Zend_Environment</a>.  People who look closer will notice that there is a &#8220;security&#8221; module for Zend_Environment, and a test framework called <a href="http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/incubator/Zend_Environment/Zend_Environment_Security_Test.html">Zend_Environment_Security_Test</a> that looks a lot like <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PhpSecInfo</a>.

Zend_Environment_Security is basically a port of the tests I&#8217;ve written for PhpSecInfo to work with Simon&#8217;s Zend_Environment module.  It does *not* replace PhpSecInfo, but rather provide a similar testing capability built into the ZFW core.  PhpSecInfo could be described as the &#8220;parent&#8221; project, with Zend_Environment_Security being based on the work I do in PSI.  PSI is *definitely* the core, and will for the foreseeable future take priority over any &#8220;sibling&#8221; projects.

Why did I only refer to my work on PSI, and not the other very helpful folks who have contributed?  Because I cannot convert any contributed code from PSI unless the contributors have signed the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement">ZFW Contributor License Agreement</a>.  For this reason, a few tests that are present in PhpSecInfo don&#8217;t have equivalents in Zend_Environment_Security.

If you have contributed tests to PhpSecInfo, or plan on doing so, I&#8217;d like you to give serious consideration to signing the Zend CLA.  It won&#8217;t put any additional burden on you, as I&#8217;ll take care of porting contributed tests to the Zend_Environment_Security model.

- <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement">Zend Contributor License Agreement</a>

Note that I will *not* require PhpSecInfo contributors to sign the Zend CLA.  If you choose not to do so, I will be happy to use your work in PhpSecInfo.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If you have questions, please let me know.</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s been (ugh) nearly 4 years since LameBrain was updated.  It was an enjoyable project, but I simply lost interest: I didn&#8217;t use the program myself, moving to encoding most of my music with the iTunes AAC encoder.  I also had pushed the app feature wise as far as I ever intended.</p>

<p>Still, people continue to search for and download LameBrain every day from this site.  It evidently scratches an itch for some people, and that&#8217;s a source of pride for me.  So I&#8217;d hate to just sit on the program and not give others an opportunity to run with it.  I think there are some valuable bits in the horribly structured code I wrote back then, and maybe someone with more drive than me will build on what&#8217;s here.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has used LameBrain, and especially to the folks who donated money for its development.  It&#8217;s been a lot of fun.</p>

After spending much time encoding my cd library in AAC format, I came to the conclusion that the LAME mp3 is far more &#8220;musical&#8221;.  I find it to be warmer and have more depth in the soundstage.  I must admit that at low bitrates the AAC is a better choice, but using a more transparent bitrate setting in LAME sounds much more like the original cd track.  Just my opinion, but thank you just the same for taking time to write LameBrain.</h2>

<p>if you do pick it back up and want to do something with handling extended ascii characters, cdex (in windows) does a good job with it by letting you choose how to handle common characters individually (for example, with &#8216;?&#8217; and &#8216;:&#8217; i like to just have it ignore them when writng the filename, but for &#8216;/&#8217; or &#8221; i like it to put a space so if i had a song called artist - title/title? it would output the filename as artist - title title.mp3 instead of artist - title_title_.mp3)</p>

<p>for what the program does, it&#8217;s already a billion times better than stupid itunes, and for that i thank you.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t distribute LB as a DMG anymore &#8212; the &#8220;Source Code&#8221; link above will give you the whole shebang you need.  It sounds like you might just be putting the LameBrain executable file into your Applications dir, and not all the extra directories.  LB needs all of those other directories to function properly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d make an /Applications/LameBrain folder and copy everything from the DMG into it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Don&#8217;t feel bad &#8212; most Mac apps are more self-contained than LameBrain.  It&#8217;s a pretty odd setup.</p>

<p>Right now, it&#8217;s really a matter of having time.  Maybe enough to take 2 months off work.  You have an extra $10k? ;)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Looks like we may need to have the msgWindow and shortMsgWindow files added to the source&#8230; when I load the project, it tries to connect via AFP to &#8220;whitesnake&#8221; (which of course it can&#8217;t), and it barfs and then asks to relocate those files&#8230; any chance we could get those put into the zip?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>

<p>p.s. do you have any intention of open source-ing the project?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for this great piece of software!  Unfortunately LameBrain doesn&#8217;t run under Leopard (10.5.6 currently).</p>

<p>Any chance you&#8217;d be so kind as to recompile it?   I tried once before with a demo of RealBasic, but it couldn&#8217;t find a certain asset it wanted (can&#8217;t remember which one, sorry) and failed to build.</p>

<p>Cheers and Happy Holidays.  Thanks for supporting the Mac community!</p>

<p>I actually could produce a new LameBrain using Titanium Desktop. I&#8217;ll have to think about that.</p>

<p>this is a great application, I love it especially for the multiuser support. One of the most useful things is the indication of how many characters have already been used up - great!</p>

<p>There are few things that I notcied with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is there a chance, that the Timeline wraps the lines? This could be configurable.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Get my timeline Ctrl+3&#8221; returns: &#8220;Error retrieving XML Data. Twitter returned &#8220;User not found&#8221;. Check your username and password.&#8221; (all other things work well, username and password are correct)</p></li>
<li><p>i added a picture to one of my accounts, but the picture does not get updated / does not appear in Spaz</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please go on with this application - bon courage!
Cheers
Georg</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Georg,</p>

<p>All good comments and ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wrapping the lines will be a bit hard, but I would like to experiment with it.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s up with getting your own timeline.  Something might have changed with the API.</p></li>
<li><p>The pictures are cached a little <em>too</em> aggressively &#8212; it never tries to look for a new one if a cached images exists.  You can delete the cache files manually, though, and it will bring in new pics.  Obviously this is a bug, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I have a bit more time I will address these things.  Thanks!</p>

<li><p>wheel mouse doesn&#8217;t work for scrolling the Tweet lists;</p></li>
<li><p>the &#8220;normal&#8221; keyboard navigation shortcuts don&#8217;t work in the text entry area. Specifically: HOME, END, Contrl+arrow keys for navigation, Control+SHIFT+arrow keys for selection.</p></li>

<p>Responses from Adobe reps on the AIR dev forums indicate that they&#8217;re aware of these problems, and intend to fix them by the time a final release appears.  I think this will be in the next few months, so I don&#8217;t think it would be worth putting the time into workarounds,</p>

<p>Look FWIW I&#8217;m loving Spaz.AIR and I&#8217;ll stick with it despite the niggles. It&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve seen on Windows so far.</p>

<p>BTW, the new progress animation doesn&#8217;t seem to animate for me &#8212; I just see a solid ring.</p>

I believe all non-7bit ASCII chars come through from Twitter as HTML entities.  Can you send me a screenshot that includes what chars are <em>not</em> working for you?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for developing spaz! I just installed it and noticed that the notification goes off for the public time-line. Is it possible to change this to only have notifications for twitter from people I&#8217;m following?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t intend to follow the whole world, just the ones I choose to and so this makes the notification sound obsolete and distracting, since it rings ever minute.</p>

<p>Anyway, you get my drift. Is this a valid request? I&#8217;m already thrilled with what you have made.</p>

If you&#8217;re on the AIR version and hearing notification sounds, then you have the latest dev version.  I&#8217;m definitely tweaking when the notification sounds go off &#8212; my intention is to only have them go off when you have <em>new</em> messages from people you are following.  This should be the case when I release the final 0.2.0.</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliments!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Graeme: both good ideas.  The first one would probably be the better way to go, because while the API allows you to specify a &#8220;since&#8221; parameter when retrieving a timeline, it will still max out at 20 tweets.  Paging back through your friends timeline would give you the ability to view more than 20, and would be a lot easier to implement. ;)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Howdy. Love the new 0.2.2 update, and the fact that the detection and installation were automatic.</p>

<p>The paging seems good, gimme a few days to road test it.</p>

<p>Two odd things:
* No matter what I put for &#8220;Refresh interval&#8221; it reverts to 2 as soon as I leave the field.
* There seems to be some lag or block on updating the personal timeline. Even if I know there&#8217;s new tweets and force a tab reload, they don&#8217;t show up. Eventually they do but I can&#8217;t figure what what trips the update.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Graeme:</p>

<p>Refresh needs to be an integer between 2 and 60 (this is described in the What&#8217;s New document). If you&#8217;re entering integers in that range and it&#8217;s still resetting to 2, tell me what you&#8217;re putting in and I&#8217;ll try to replicate here.</p>

<p>The lag is on Twitter&#8217;s end &#8212; I&#8217;ve been seeing it some too.  Nothing&#8217;s changed in the code to retrieve that data, so AFAICT it is just Twitter being a little funky.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@funk, many thanks for such a quick response, the refresh does seem better.</p>

<p>On the &#8220;Refresh Interval&#8221; param in preferences I&#8217;m still seeing the same behaviour. Here&#8217;s exactly what happens:
* got to Prefs tab
* click inside Refresh interval field
* press Backspace to remove the &#8220;2&#8221;
* type &#8220;5&#8221;
* press Tab
* value reverts to &#8220;2&#8221;</p>

<p>alternatively&#8230;
* same previous steps up to type &#8220;5&#8221;
* don&#8217;t leave field but click on &#8220;Save Preferences&#8221;
* value reverts to &#8220;2&#8221;</p>

<p>If I manually edit &#8220;preferences.xml&#8221; and alter the interval (ie, &lt;network refreshinterval = &#8216;300000&#8217;/&gt;) it does pick it up on restart.</p>

<p>If you want me to dump HTML or enable debugging or whatever, let me know. I can try tracking it through Firebug if you like.</p>

* restart 0.2.5
* receive update notice and click Yes
* update succeeds

<p>Spaz just keeps getting better! And with mousewheel support and keyboard shortcuts working, I couldn&#8217;t be happier. It&#8217;s a beautiful piece of work; gratz guys. Loving the &#8220;whitespace&#8221; theme, btw. And the Tokyo Subway sounds are great, too.</p>

<p>Graeme, not sure about the issues you&#8217;re having. Best I&#8217;d could say is to report the problem to Adobe&#8217;s AIR team.</p>

<li><p>i tried switching themes with the vague idea it might help. it doesn&#8217;t.</p></li>
<li><p>I then uninstalled it and killed all the Spaz folders I could find in Documents and Settings (only one I think under C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;&lt;user&gt;&#92;Application Data). When I reinstalled, all was sweetness and light! (erm, meaning it works).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>BTW, for mine, a systray icon is useless.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@James: the first issue is because of a change between AIR beta 1 and b2, the consequence of which is that some timelines are only returning data that is new in the past 24 hours. If you haven&#8217;t followed anyone new recently, you&#8217;ll see that.  I&#8217;ve fixed this in my current dev version, though, so you should see it working properly in the next release.</p>

<p>The second thing you saw was probably Twitter mucking up or you exceeding the 70 requests per hour limit. The next version will report request limit probs more clearly, if they come up.</p>

<p>I might consider putting in a pref to disable reporting of the app to Twitter, though, if users were interested in that.  You can also download and modify the source code as you wish (http://code.google.com/p/spaz).</p>

<p>However, I have to say that the default style is THE ugliest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen and my repeated attempts to make it use a different style have failed miserably. Each time I choose a different style and then click &#8220;Save Preferences&#8221;, it either crashes or the style is gone when I restart the app. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Oh, and the icon also disturbs me&#8230; kind of a lot. I will be replacing that immediately.</p>

<p>All that being said, THANK YOU! I think this could be a really great app.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I twittered about this, but twitter is being useless today, so I thought I&#8217;d mention it here.</p>

<p>This is a really cool app, but I&#8217;ve noticed (on WinXP) that it&#8217;s a memory hog.  On launch, Task Manager reports is using 40MB of RAM.  I just had to shut it down as it climbed to 110MB used. As I was typing a tweet, I could watch usage climb about 400k per letter typed.  Any idea what&#8217;s going on here?  Anything I can do to help debug?  You&#8217;d have to hold my hand, though - I&#8217;m not a developer.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

I&#8217;ve not seen the memory climb the way you describe while typing, but on each timeline reload you will see a jump. There&#8217;s not much we can do about it until Adobe fixes the issue, I don&#8217;t think. Sorry!</p>

I&#8217;ll poke around a bit and see what&#8217;s involved. You might consider filing an issue (See &#8220;Get Help&#8221; above).</p>

<p>@Tiara: this is an issue with AIR, and unfortunately not something I can fix. I&#8217;d recommend filing a bug with Adobe.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this happen too, and I assume something has been corrupted in the download. you can grab the file manually at funkatron.com/getspaz. Sometimes that helps. Otherwise, you may want to search your machine for where AIR is caching the downloaded .air package and delete any of these; this may force a proper re-download.</p>

<p><a href='http://funkatron.com/apps/lamebrain/LameBrain_Source_Code.zip' rel='attachment wp-att-611' title='LameBrain Source Code'><img src='http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/lamebrain-icon.png' alt='LameBrain icon' align="right" /></a>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/lamebrain/LameBrain_Source_Code.zip">the source code for LameBrain</a>, my LAME-based mp3 encoder for OS X.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been (ugh) nearly 4 years since LameBrain was updated.  It was an enjoyable project, but I simply lost interest: I didn&#8217;t use the program myself, moving to encoding most of my music with the iTunes AAC encoder.  I also had pushed the app feature wise as far as I ever intended.</p>

<p>Still, people continue to search for and download LameBrain every day from this site.  It evidently scratches an itch for some people, and that&#8217;s a source of pride for me.  So I&#8217;d hate to just sit on the program and not give others an opportunity to run with it.  I think there are some valuable bits in the horribly structured code I wrote back then, and maybe someone with more drive than me will build on what&#8217;s here.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has used LameBrain, and especially to the folks who donated money for its development.  It&#8217;s been a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been coding PHP for 8 years now, and it can be hard to jump into another language when you&#8217;re so entrenched in the syntax and quirks of another.  However, I still think it&#8217;s a useful exercise from an intellectual standpoint to dabble in &#8220;competitors&#8221; to PHP, like Python and Ruby.  It can also provide some real productivity gains when you leverage something another language does more effectively than PHP.</p>

<p>The Web2.0 kids love to chatter about Ruby&#8217;s beauty and elegance and super awesomeness.  I don&#8217;t give a crap about that per se, but their groovy love-in has produced some <em>very</em> nice libraries for handling Web2.0-ish stuff like XML feeds.  The <a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/">FeedTools</a> lib is a very comprehensive, very powerful Ruby library that makes creating, consuming and manipulating feeds <em>much</em> easier &#8212; moreso than anything I&#8217;ve found in PHP.</p>

<p>Ruby existed as a good general-purpose scripting language long before Rails made it a nerd-hipster household name, and that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to use it here: as a good ol&#8217; fashioned CLI script to aggregate a few separate XML feeds into a single aggregated feed.  You&#8217;ll need to have Ruby and the <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> package manager installed, which is an exercise left up to the reader (it varies from platform to platform).  Once we have them working, you&#8217;ll need to install the <a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/">FeedTools</a> gem:</p>

<pre>
# gem install feedtools
</pre>

<p>Now that we have that installed, you can use the feed_tools library in your Ruby scripts.  Here&#8217;s a script I wrote to aggregate three feeds from <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">CERIAS</a> into a single combo feed:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require "RubyGems"
require "feed_tools"

feedurls = %w(http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/feeds/news
  http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/weblogs/feed/
  http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/feeds/seminars_podcast)

combo = FeedTools::build_merged_feed feedurls

combo.feed_type = 'atom'
combo.title = 'CERIAS Super Combined Feed'
combo.copyright = '2006 CERIAS'
combo.author = 'CERIAS &lt;webmaster@cerias.purdue.edu&gt;'
combo.id = "http://foo.bar/foobar/combo.xml"

File.open('./combo.xml', 'w') do |file|
  file.puts combo.build_xml()
end

puts "done writing"
</pre>

<p>To execute this, you&#8217;ll want to do something like:</p>

<pre>
# ruby /path/to/script/generatecombo.rb
</pre>

<p>The best idea would be to run this as a cron job, as the feed combination process takes maybe a minute even for just these three feeds.</p>

<p>I think most of the script is pretty self-explanatory, but let&#8217;s break it down:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require "RubyGems"
require "feed_tools"
</pre>

<p>This works just like you&#8217;d imagine.  Note that to use gem libs, we <em>need</em> to require the RubyGems lib first, as it does some mucketymuck with the require statement to get it to handle gems properly.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
feedurls = %w(http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/feeds/news
  http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/weblogs/feed/
  http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/feeds/seminars_podcast)
</pre>

<p>This section just makes an array called <code>feedurls</code> that contains the three feed URLs.  <code>%w(...)</code> is just a handy little shorthand for &#8220;treat the stuff between the parentheses as a string, and explode it into an array with whitespace as the delimiter&#8221;.  I <strong>really</strong> wish PHP had something like this, as writing out array data can be pretty tedious.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
combo = FeedTools::build_merged_feed feedurls
</pre>

<p>This is the line that does all the work of combining the feeds.  One line.  Pretty smooth.  So we now have a Feed object called <code>combo</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
combo.feed_type = 'atom'
combo.title = 'CERIAS Super Combined Feed'
combo.copyright = '2006 CERIAS'
combo.author = 'CERIAS &lt;webmaster@cerias.purdue.edu&gt;'
combo.id = "http://foo.bar/foobar/combo.xml"
</pre>

<p>We need to set a few properties for <code>combo</code> before it can be published, though.  A couple might not be self-explanatory:</p>

<ul>
<li><code><a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/api/classes/FeedTools/Feed.html#M000077">feed_type</a></code> determines your feed format.</li>
<li><code><a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/api/classes/FeedTools/Feed.html#M000082">id</a></code> sets a unique URL for the feed</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more attributes for feeds available; read the docs on <a href="http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/api/classes/FeedTools/Feed.html">the Feed class</a> for more info.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
File.open('./combo.xml', 'w') do |file|
  file.puts combo.build_xml()
end
</pre>

<p>The <code>build_xml</code> method generates the XML for the feed object we&#8217;ve created.  This final piece of code opens (or creates and opens, if necessary) a file called &#8220;combo.xml&#8221; in the current directory and writes that XML.  The file is automatically closed when this block finished executing.  </p>

<p>So, we now have a nice combined XML feed, ready to be parsed into our PHP apps using <a href="http://simplepie.org">Simplepie</a> or <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.html">Zend_Feed</a>, and/or served up as-is to feed reading clients.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/2/8/6968">Ars Technica: Antibiotic use conclusively linked to bacterial resistance</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Prior to the development of the first antibiotics in the 1930s, surgery carried a much greater risk of mortality from post-operative infection, and many diseases we take for granted today were life-threatening.  But massive over-prescription and the use of antibiotics as livestock growth supplements have lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains such as MRSA and VRSA that are a growing problem in hospitals around the world.</blockquote>

And hold onto the ball.  And throw to open people.  And not throw off your back foot.<br /><br />Dammit, Berrian had them <em>beat</em>, and if Grossman hadn&#8217;t underthrown the ball by 10 yards, it&#8217;s a 4 point game with 9 minutes left.<br /><br />Well, Peyton needed to win one.  But him getting the MVP was horseshit &#8212; Rhodes or Addai deserved it more.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not sure what the Bears should do with Grossman next year.  If he makes serious improvement in his mechanics, then he could be top-notch.  For now, though, he&#8217;s a liability.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soledadpenades.com/2007/01/22/php-will-never-have-a-real-rails-like-framework/">Soledad Penad&eacute;s says &#8220;PHP will never have a (real) Rails-like framework.&#8221;</a> She&#8217;s right. And people need to quit getting their panties in a bunch about this fact.</p>

<blockquote>I know the title is harsh but it’s so true. At least it is according to nowadays php’s implementation of classes and objects, which do not permit to “reopen” and add or redefine new methods to an existing class definition, which is the basis upon Rails (and I presume lots more of applications and frameworks) is built.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s particularly harsh; it&#8217;s just a matter of fact.  I love PHP, and I&#8217;ve been working in it for the past 8 years, but I need to be a grown-up about this and realize that while it&#8217;s very good for some kinds of things, it is not &#8212; and has never tried to be &#8212; the be-all-end-all of scripting languages.  It&#8217;s accessible, fairly simple, and easy to use in web apps.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s rather funny that in the comments so many people are throwing links to PHP frameworks at her, saying &#8220;but, but, but <strong>this</strong> one really is as good as Rails!&#8221;  Guys, please, <em>calm down</em>.  Your testicles have not withered and dropped off because 37 Signals did a good job marketing their framework to The Blogosphere, turning Rails into the programming buzzword for Web2.0.  Just take a deep breath and speak the following mantra until your blood pressure drops: &#8220;Digg, Flickr, Yahoo, Wikipedia&#8230; Digg, Flickr, Yahoo, Wikipedia&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Look, PHP is not Ruby.  It&#8217;s not Scheme.  It&#8217;s not Java.  It&#8217;s not C.  There are great things to be learned and outright stolen from each of these languages, but PHP devs need to stop sweating these stupid language pissing matches and appreciate PHP for what it is.  And maybe spend an evening going through a Ruby tutorial &#8212; it&#8217;ll be good for you.</p>

A few items that hook into OS X-specific technologies aren&#8217;t ported, but shell commands are handled by your Cygwin install on Windows.  It works surprisingly well.</p>

<p><strong>e</strong> also has what seems to be a unique feature &#8212; <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/blog/2006/making-undo-usable">an integrated revision control system</a> that enables collaborative editing and a very powerful, advanced &#8220;undo&#8221; functionality.  I haven&#8217;t delved into this much, but it looks like a really cool feature.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how much longer I&#8217;ll be using a Windows box as a primary development machine, but for as long as I do, <strong>e</strong> <em>will</em> be my main text editor.  Even in its current beta, semi-buggy state, it&#8217;s head and shoulders above anything else I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>Adobe Illustrator is a lovely vector drawing tool, but one of the places where it&#8217;s mucho lame is in dealing with rounded corners on objects.&nbsp; There actually is a Rounded Corner tool in Illustrator CS2 (maybe earlier too, I can&#8217;t recall), but you can&#8217;t edit the corner roundness after you&#8217;ve drawn the object. <i><b>LAME</b>.</i></p>

<p>To apply rounded corners to an existing object, there is a filter called &#8220;Rounded Corners,&#8221; but this will only round <i>all</i> of the object corners.&nbsp; Sometimes this is fine, but yesterday I wanted to be all Web2.0 and only round 1 corner of an object. I could have made a rectangle with standard corners and do some magic with object mashing, but that&#8217;s fruity.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I came across <a href="http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html">a handy little collection of scripts for Illustrator CS and CS2</a>.&nbsp; One of the scripts is called &#8220;<a href="http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html#roundany">Round Any Corner</a>,&#8221; and it lets you select a single corner point and apply rounding only to that corner.&nbsp; Totally awesome timesaver for when you&#8217;re trying to make your <a href="http://www.andrewwooldridge.com/myapps/webtwopointoh.html">hipster Internet startup</a> web site.</p>

<p><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on OS X has me completely spoiled, and I really really miss a good text editor on Windows.&nbsp; Much of it has to do with aesthetics, and the fact that the monospaced fonts on Windows suck ass.&nbsp; Thankfully, I found <a href="http://keithdevens.com/wiki/ProgrammerFonts">a cool page that collects links to a bunch of programming-oriented fonts</a>, which will help me escape from the crappiness of Courier New.&nbsp; The TextMate Wiki also has <a href="http://macromates.com/wiki/Main/AlternativeFonts">a good page</a> on alternative fonts for people who are sick of Monaco on OS X (although Monaco is <i>much </i>better than any monospaced font that ships with Windows).<br /><br />The fonts I&#8217;m digging are:<br /></p>

<ul><li><a href="http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">DejaVu Sans Mono</a> (has native bold and italic)</li><li><a href="http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/">ProFont</a></li><li><a href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">ProggyClean</a></li><li><a href="http://www.bok.net/MonteCarlo/">MonteCarlo</a> (the bitmap .fon version)</li><li><a href="http://www.netalive.org/tinkering/triskweline/">Triskweline</a> (the bitmap .fon version)</li><li><a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></li></ul>

The project&#8217;s <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents &amp; Files page</a> offers downloads of versions as new as December 9, 2006, including an &#8220;experimental&#8221; Universal Binary build of SCPlugin.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to test this yet, but this is certainly encouraging.</p>

<p>For the past few years, PHP security experts have been pounding on the heads of sysadmins to <strong>turn off <a href="http://php.net/register_globals">register_globals</a></strong>.  While default installs of PHP turn it off, some popular web apps (especially older versions) insist on using it, so some webhost sysadmins will turn it on, presumably to make things go smoothly for their customers.  Oops!</p>

<p><a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-0233">CVE-2007-0233</a>, what seems like the 300th Wordpress vulnerability in the last two weeks, reports an sql injection vulnerability in Wordpress 2.0.6 (which was only released 11 days ago).  The exploit appears to rely on register_globals being enabled, though:</p>

<pre>
funkatron@foo > php xpl.php foo.com /wp/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wordpress < = 2.0.6 wp-trackback.php Zend_Hash_Del_Key_Or_Index /
/ sql injection admin hash disclosure exploit
(needs register_globals=on, 4 <= PHP < 4.4.3,< 5.1.4)
by rgod
dork: "is proudly powered by WordPress"
mail: retrog at alice dot it
site: http://retrogod.altervista.org
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

pwd hash   ->
admin user ->
exploit failed...
</pre>

<p>This is a good example of why web app security (and any security, for that matter) must be multilayered: on the hardware level, on the server daemon level, on the language environment level, and on the code level.</p>

<p>So, for the love of god, STOP ENABLING REGISTER_GLOBALS, upgrade to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-207/">Wordpress 2.0.7</a>, and  (shameless plug) use <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PhpSecInfo</a> to audit your PHP environment. ;)</p>

<p><img src="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads//c64.gif" border="0" height="212" width="200" alt="c64.gif" align="right" />For my new C64-inspired Wordpress theme, I really wanted to use authentic colors and characters.  I used <a href="http://www.infinite-loop.at/Power64/index.html">Power64</a>, a C64 emulator for PPC, to generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETSCII">the block graphics characters</a> that were unique to Commodore machines.  For the colors, I made a 16-color palette from an image I found on <a href="http://alex.kazik.de/en/convert.html">Alex Kazik&#8217;s site</a> that included the 16 colors supported by the C64.  Now I can use this palette to convert full-color images to 16-color ones that have a C64 &#8220;look.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a href="/downloads/c64-pallette.act.zip">download the .act palette</a>.  It should work fine with Photoshop and Fireworks.</p>

<p>In the php.ini file used by the PHP5 executable, the include path is hosed.&nbsp; If you installed in the default location and are running Windows, you&#8217;ll probably find the file at</p>

<pre>C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\php5\php.ini</pre>

<p>This line is from the original file:</p>

<pre>include_path = C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\ZendFramework\library;.</pre>

<p>You might notice that the value is not wrapped in quotes, which makes the ; character demark the beginning of a comment.  That eliminates your current working directory from the include path, which is a pretty major disaster when requiring external files into your script.  The solution is (taa-daa!) to wrap the value in quotes:</p>

<pre>include_path = "C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendStudio-5.5.0\bin\ZendFramework\library;."</pre>

<p>What&#8217;s more annoying is that this bug was in the Beta of 5.5 as well, and apparently didn&#8217;t get fixed.</p>

<p>First off, <a href="http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/" title="PHPSecInfo">a new build of PHPSecInfo is out</a>: Version 0.1.2, build
20061218. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Code is now licensed under &#8220;New BSD&#8221; license. See LICENSE</p></li>
<li><p>Added PhpSecInfo_Test_Core_Allow_Url_Include to test for
allow_url_include in PHP5.2 and above</p></li>
<li><p>fix bug in post_max_size check where upload_max_size value was being
checked</p></li>
<li><p>change curl file_support test to recommend upgrading to newest
version of PHP rather than disabling support in cURL for &#8216;file://&#8217;
protocol</p></li>
<li><p>removed =&amp; calls that force pass by reference in PHP4, so as to not
throw PHP5 STRICT notices. It means passing objects by value in PHP4,
but this seems acceptable for our purposes (memory usage isn&#8217;t
terribly high).</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in PhpSecInfo_Test_Session_Use_Trans_Sid where wrong ini
key was requested (Thanks Mark Wallert)</p></li>
<li><p>New, detailed README file with explanations and basic usage
instructions - Now providing an md5 hash for releases</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do in the next few releases:</p>

<ol>
<li>More detailed test results, including the current and recommended
settings</li>
<li>A web-based &#8220;glossary&#8221; with more details on each test &amp;
how to fix problems</li>
<li>More tests!!! I especially need your help with
this one!</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to look into options to reformat the test result
structure, so it plays more nicely with templating systems. No
promises on how this will go, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>Jesus, it looks like I just wiped my ass with that screenshot.  I will have to buy the game, even though it will surely suck.  Maybe the fact that they did voice recording in <strong>2004</strong> has something to do with its dated look.  Man, this property deserves so much better.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/news/newsarticle.asp?searchid=13580"><img width="425" vspace="4" hspace="4" height="307" border="1" src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2006/12/theshield.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Chiklis gets cheeky in The Shield video game</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://macheist.com/">Macheist</a> folks have finally quit fucking around with fruity puzzles and just started selling software cheap.&nbsp; This is apparently their final hurrah before the whole thing sinks back into the primordial ooze from which flash sites are born.&nbsp; The deal they&#8217;re offering is pretty sweet: a bundle of 8 (and maybe 2 more) shareware apps that would cost nearly $300 individually for <b>$49</b>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a hot deal, and one I&#8217;d jump on&#8230; except the stuff I <i>really</i> want, I already own.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re offering:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>Delicious Library</b> - totally kickass, but I own it and don&#8217;t really need another copy for any reason.<br /></li><li><b>FotoMagic </b>- apparently lets you make fancy slideshows.&nbsp; Eh&#8230; not compelling.</li><li><b>Shapeshifter </b>- own it, but only one license, and it would make sense to have two for my two macs (I&#8217;m cheating right now)</li><li><b>DEVONthink personal </b>- one of those organization tools that I use for like a week and then end up never opening again</li><li><b>Disco </b>- a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/11/03/dissing-disco/3">wildy overhyped</a> CD/DVD burning tool that I don&#8217;t want to buy on principle</li><li><b>RapidWeaver </b>- A pretty fancy WYSIWYG web page authoring tool.&nbsp; Looks kinda cool, but it&#8217;s so outside of my usual workflow that I&#8217;m unsure if I&#8217;d ever need it</li><li><b>iClip 4</b> - a more kickass clipboard.&nbsp; Yeah, I just don&#8217;t do that much with the clipboard to make this worthwhile</li><li>One game from <b>Pangea </b>- All of their games look stupid, honestly.&nbsp; If it was a game from <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/">Ambrosia</a>, I&#8217;d totally be up on this</li></ul>

<p><br />If 5000 bundles are sold:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>NewsFire </b>- a desktop RSS reader that seemed pretty cool, but I already own NewsNewsWire and NewsFire wasn&#8217;t <i>that</i> much cooler.</li></ul>

<p><br />If 10000 bundles are sold:<br /></p>

<ul><li><b>TextMate </b>- The best text editor I&#8217;ve ever used, period.&nbsp; I also already own it, but another license would keep me morally sound.<br /></li></ul>

<p>OTOH, 25% of the proceeds go to charity, and even as-is it&#8217;s probably worth $49 to me.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not a slam dunk for sure.</p>

<p>Deadspin comes through again to let us know that Freddie &#8220;FredEx&#8221; Mitchell, washed-up shit-talking ex-receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, was recently <a href="http://www.deadspin.com/sports/nfl/in-case-you-were-wondering-what-freddie-mitchell-has-been-up-to-lately-217314.php">working as a substitute HS teacher in Mishawaka, IN</a>:<br /></p>

<blockquote>Supposedly the woman who was his kid&#8217;s mother lives in town, and he needed some extra money. He lasted all of one week, due to the fact that he was caught asking girls for their phone numbers.</blockquote>

<p>More on the awesomeness of FredEx:<br /></p>

<p>I went to HS about 4 miles from Mishawaka High School, was in a band with a couple guys from there, and lived in Mishawaka for about 4 years, which is why I&#8217;m flipping out about this.</p>

<p>Things are going better.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anything will be disappearing, but adjustments as to my focus(es) in life are happening and will continue.&nbsp; It&#8217;s exciting, but a little scary &#8212; fear of change and fear of regret are chronic problems for me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad that I have a strong support system of family and friends who help me and support me when I go a little crazy.</p>

<p>So I bought the php|arch PHP4 certification study guide a couple months before <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/" title="OSCON 2006">OSCON 2006</a>.  It took a while to get to my house (like a few weeks) and by that time, Zend was all talking up the PHP5 cert program.  Now <a href="http://benramsey.com/" title="Ben Ramsey">Ben Ramsey</a>, the evil bastard he is, has <a href="http://benramsey.com/archives/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-published/#comments" title="I hate you Ben">the PHP5 cert guide</a> he wrote with Davey Shafik out from php|arch.  I hate you, Ben.  Can&#8217;t I get a rebate or something on the new book?</p>

<p>This version fixes the errant Notices we were getting, makes it easier to extract test data for your own nefarious purposes, and fixes a bug with the curl file protocol test on PHP4.  The latter unfortunately just skips the test on PHP4 because I&#8217;m not sure how to do the check; suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>Download: <a href="http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/phpsecinfo.zip" title="PHPSecInfo">http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/phpsecinfo.zip</a></p>

<p>Docs: <a href="http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/docs/" title="PHPSecInfo Docs">http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/docs/</a></p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s new:</strong>
v0.1.1
 - Added PhpSecInfo::getOutput(), PhpSecInfo::loadAndRun() and PhpSecInfo::getResultsAsArray() methods
 - Modified PhpSecInfo::runTests() to fix undefined offsent notices
 - Modified PhpSecInfo_Test::setMessageForResult() to fix undefined offset notices
 - Modified PhpSecInfo_Test_Curl_File_Support to skip if PHP version is &lt; 5 (detection of file protocol support relies on PHP5 version of curl_version)</p>

<p>I decided to not be all self-deprecating as I usually am with things like this, and admit that I&#8217;m really happy and proud to say that I was interviewed by Cal Evans for the <a href="http://devzone.zend.com" title="">Zend Developer Zone</a>.</p>

<p />

<blockquote><strong>I guess the first question that comes to my mind is “Why did you build this?”</strong><br />
I built it because there was no good way to audit the security settings in your PHP.INI or your PHP environment. The average PHP user I feel is someone who can use an installer to install scripts on their server, get them running and do a little customization or hack up some code but they are not educated developers. These users have no easy way to check how secure their environment is. So I wrote PHPSecInfo to give these uses something easy to run and present the information in a format they are already familiar with.</blockquote>

<p>It really bothers me when people talk about how the place I live is objectively bad.&nbsp; Not &#8220;I don&#8217;t like [place]&#8221;, but &#8220;[the place I live] is hell.&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard not to take that as a slap in my own face, because I live here by choice, and actually like it pretty well.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t like it here, but try to be a bit more respectful of the people who do, because not all of them are the slack-jawed yokels you seem to think permeate the population.</p>

<p>from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/30/AR2006093000293.html">The Washington Post:</a><br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made three tragic decisions,&#8221; Garner told Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Rumsfeld asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three terrible mistakes,&#8221; Garner said.</p>
<p>He cited the first two orders Bremer signed when he arrived, the first one banning as many as 50,000 members of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Baath Party from government jobs and the second disbanding the Iraqi military. Now there were hundreds of thousands of disorganized, unemployed, armed Iraqis running around.</p>
<p>Third, Garner said, Bremer had summarily dismissed an interim Iraqi leadership group that had been eager to help the United States administer the country in the short term. &#8220;Jerry Bremer can&#8217;t be the face of the government to the Iraqi people. You&#8217;ve got to have an Iraqi face for the Iraqi people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garner made his final point: &#8220;There&#8217;s still time to rectify this. There&#8217;s still time to turn it around.&#8221;</p>
Rumsfeld looked at Garner for a moment with his take-no-prisoners gaze. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is anything we can do, because we are where we are.&#8221;<br /><br />He thinks I&#8217;ve lost it, Garner thought. He thinks I&#8217;m absolutely wrong. Garner didn&#8217;t want it to sound like sour grapes, but facts were facts. &#8220;They&#8217;re all reversible,&#8221; Garner said again.<br /><br />&#8221;<strong>We&#8217;re not going to go back</strong>,&#8221; Rumsfeld said emphatically. </blockquote>

<p>So today I had to wait at home in the afternoon for the cable dude to come and hook up the <a href="http://broadband.motorola.com/dvr/dct6412.asp" target="_blank">HD DVR box</a>.  We&#8217;ve had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HL-R4266W-Widescreen-HDTV-DLP/dp/B0009EXVIA" target="_blank">an HDTV</a> for about a week now and love it, but haven&#8217;t had a lot of true HD content to view on it.  We don&#8217;t have a whole lot now, but it&#8217;s maybe 12 channels that can carry HD content.  Sports HD content does look really freakin&#8217; good, as does the HD content on HBO.</p>

<p>We also got some crappy cable wiring changed out.  I mentioned that I thought sometimes we were getting low signal power to the tech, and he apparently agreed when he viewed the signal meter and asked to see where the cable was coming in.  I showed him our splitter box, and he said &#8220;how is this working??&#8221;  Apparently the cable that was running in from outside was not the proper type (he called it &#8220;copper&#8221;, but isn&#8217;t it all copper?), and he expected that we would have had more problems than we were.  He also said the guy who first set us up here should have noticed this and fixed it.  Go team!  Anyway, we put in new cable and he saw a +6 dB increase in signal (which I think is significant).  Hopefully we&#8217;ll have less cable modem drops than before.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is now going to be sorting out how to integrate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TiVo-TCD540040-Series2-Digital-Recorder/dp/B00029ZE2S" target="_blank">my wondeful Tivo</a> with this setup.  The HD DVR box can record shows, but it&#8217;s extremely basic in terms of functionality when compared to the Tivo unit.  It can send a downsampled signal out of its composite outputs, so for now I have the Tivo hooked up to that, but I&#8217;m not really sure how having two options for watching TV will work out.  The Tivo made everything so easy, and I&#8217;m loathe to complicate things.  I could have kept the standard digital cable box, but I decided to save the $8 a month that would have cost on top of my other increases for HD.  At the end of the day, tho, $8 ain&#8217;t much, so maybe I&#8217;ll ask for another one.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>Oh, and I&#8217;m really glad I got a TV with lots of inputs, including 2 HDMI inputs.  I can use one for my DVD player and one for the HD DVR box.  The cables are kinda crazy now with all the power cables and Tivo &amp; <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/" target="_blank">Xbox</a> output, but it would be BATSHIT (8 more than now) if I was running component.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I am SO lusting for an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/12/apple-to-release-itv-video-streaming-box-in-2007/" target="_blank">iTV</a> now, so long as it can output HDTV resolution video and someone hacks around the iTunes requirement.  It would be such an awesome front-end for something like <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/" target="_blank">MythTV</a>.</p>

<blockquote>One day, God willing, Russell Baer was going to tell his son this story. One day, after the boy&#8217;s heart and brain had healed, he was going to point to that picture on the kid&#8217;s bedroom shelf of the man doing a handstand on the roof of a house, take a deep breath and say, <em>Mav, that&#8217;s a man who lived a life as pure and died a death as muddy as any man ever to walk this rock, and I was there for both. That&#8217;s the man, when your heart stopped for an hour and they slit you open neck to navel, who I prayed to because &#8230; well, because you wouldn&#8217;t exist if he hadn&#8217;t died, and I wouldn&#8217;t be half of who I am if he hadn&#8217;t taught me how to live. That&#8217;s Pat Tillman, the man you take your middle name from, and I&#8217;ve been waiting for you to ask since the day you were born.</em><br /><br />Russ never got that chance: Maverick Patrick Baer died on Monday. So now Russ has Pat&#8217;s story stuck in his heart&#8230;. </blockquote>

<p>Yeah, so I was a bit distracted this weekend (which was a 4-day for me because I took Friday off, although I was doing contracting work much of that day) because we bought a new TV and stand, and I just realized that I am giving a seminar on Wednesday.  This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if I knew what I was gonna talk about.  I think I&#8217;m going to need to just tweak something I have done before, because there&#8217;s no way I can come up with a new one in a day and a half.  Plus, I think I was supposed to turn in a title and abstract like 4 days ago.</p>

<p>A couple tips for administrators of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/contribute/">Contribute</a> 3 content management systems:</p>

<ul> <li>If you lose your site administrator password, Macromedia/Adobe tells you some lies about having to wipe out all the Contribute settings on your server.&nbsp; <strong>This is not at all true</strong>.&nbsp; Do this to reset the password without wiping out your settings:  <ol> <li>in the document root of your server, there will be a <strong>_mm </strong>directory.&nbsp; In that directory, find a file called something like <strong>cthub[a bunch of numbers].csi</strong>.&nbsp; This is the file that stores your Contribute site settings.  <li>Make a copy of the <strong>cthub</strong>[&#8230;]<strong>.csi</strong> file, so you can restore it if you mess something up.  <li>Edit the file with a text editor (it&#8217;s just an XML file), and change the admin_password and admin_password_salt values to empty strings, like so:<br> <blockquote> <p>&lt;admin_password value=&#8221; /&gt;<br>&lt;admin_password_salt value=&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote> <li> <p><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/0002198d" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px" height="97" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/00022y69" width="137" align="right"></a> Now you can make a new connection to the site and make yourself part of the Administrator role without having to enter a password.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll want to set up a new password under <em>Administer Website » Administration</em>, though, and Contribute will complain if you don&#8217;t, so listen to it.</p></li></ol> <li> <p>Is Contribute not accepting your SFTP username and password, even though it works fine in other programs?&nbsp;&nbsp;It might&nbsp;be a weird issue with sshd that I only&nbsp;recently came across, and solved thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://altbit.org/?p=173">a blog post at altbit.org</a>.&nbsp; It seems that Contribute will not work if <strong>PasswordAuthentication no </strong>is set in the&nbsp;sshd_config file on your server, even if <strong>UsePAM yes</strong> is enabled.&nbsp; So, you <em>must</em> enable <strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong> for Contribute to connect.&nbsp; Fruity.</p></li></ul>

<p></li></li></li></li></p>

<p><a href="http://digg.com/security/Spafford_On_the_Use_of_Lie_Detectors_by_the_US_Gov_t">Interesting article</a> in zee work blog:</p>

<blockquote>Noted security and cybercrime expert Eugene Spafford discusses the challenges and complexities in the use of lie detectors by the US Government to screen for security clearances.  &#8220;Lie detectors have a non-zero rate of error. As with many real-world systems, these errors manifest as Type I errors (alpha error, false positive) and Type II errors (beta error, false negative), and instances of &#8216;can&#8217;t tell.&#8217; It&#8217;s important to understand the distinction because the errors and ambiguities in any system may not be equally likely, and the consequences may be very different.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>Everybody and their mom has feed parsers built into their fancy frameworks and component libraries, and a couple stand-alone components do an excellent job of making feed consumption a piece of cake, but XML feed <em>creation</em> tools are really lacking in PHP.&nbsp; Of all the major general purpose PHP framework/component&nbsp;collections I know of (PEAR, EZC, ZFW, Cake, Symfony, CodeIgniter), none include a class for creating XML feeds.</p>

<p>The best tool I&#8217;ve seen for the job is Kai Blankenhorn&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bitfolge.de/rsscreator-en.html">FeedCreator</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve used it quite a bit, and it&#8217;s a well-designed class that makes feed creation very easy.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not thoroughly documented, though, and hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2004, so no ATOM 1.0 support.&nbsp; More problematic is that it doesn&#8217;t support enclosures, making it&nbsp;mostly useless&nbsp;for folks wanting to *Cast stuff.</p>

<p>A couple of forks have popped up here and there to address these problems.&nbsp; <a href="http://feedcreator.org/">This one</a>&nbsp;by Mohammad Hafiz bin Ismail&nbsp;has the advantage of looking more like a serious attempt to restart development of the project, rather than a onetime hack to add a couple features.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t look like a lot of development has gone on since the initial upload, though, and that&#8217;s a bummer.</p>

<p>So tell me: am I missing something, or is this an area where more work needs to be done?</p>

<p>So this new blogging tool from Microsoft, <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>, is pretty nice.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first Windows blogging client that works with LJ that didn&#8217;t make me want to stab myself in the eye.&nbsp; It also apparently works with Blogger,&nbsp;TypePad, WordPress, Movable Type, and other stuff that uses the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">Metaweblog API</a> or the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/mt-static/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">Movable Type API</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s embracement of the blogging community seems to have inspired much better UI design and use of open stadards.&nbsp; I&#8217;m very pleased.</p>

<p><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/0001z8z0" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="233" alt="Screenshot from Windows Live Writer" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/funkatron/pic/0001y1a1" width="240" border="0"></a> </p>

<p>The image insertion stuff is the <em>bomb</em>.&nbsp; It auto-generates a thumbnail with a neat little dropshadow, and you can apply watermark text and basic effects (sepia, b&amp;w, sharpen, et al), and do more operations.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> when you browse for a picture it only filters for .gif and .jpg, but you can change the file type to All Files and use PNGs.</p>

<p>So while I&#8217;ve been generally very happy with Dreamhost, the shared account i have just hasn&#8217;t been able to keep up with the needs of one of my particularly popular sites.  So, I signed up for a VPS account with <a href="http://vpslink.com">http://vpslink.com</a>.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re not familiar with VPS hosting, it stands for Virtual Private Server.  I think there are a few different ways of implementing it, with VPSLink using Virtuozzo (<a href="http://www.swsoft.com/en/products/virtuozzo/">http://www.swsoft.com/en/products/virt<wbr />uozzo/</a>), but basically it entails setting up several virtual machines on one actual server.  These VMs act completely independently of one another, and the customer has full root access on it, but you share the resources of the physical machine with other users.  Basically it ends up being somewhere between a shared account and a dedicated machine in terms of price and performance.<br /><br />I decided on Ubuntu 6.06 for my OS.  I like the Debian package manager, but Ubuntu is a little bit more current with the software they support, and I have a tendency to want to try out new stuff.  It&#8217;s still been really easy for me to set up, even thought I&#8217;m only using the shell account to install and config shit.  It&#8217;s been a good learning experience and assessment of my real knowledge of system administration:<br /><br />&#8212; I know how to set up Apache, PHP and related shit very, very well<br />&#8212; I know how to set up MySQL and PostgreSQL pretty well<br />&#8212; I know very little about setting up mail servers (well, until now)<br />&#8212; DNS and Bind is just beyond me<br /><br />I&#8217;m avoiding messing with DNS too much right now, because looking at Bind and the docs for it made my head explode, but I was able to get Postfix and Dovecot up and running with some research and careful reading of HOWTOs.  Apache et al was a piece of cake, and mega fast thanks to aptitude / apt-get and the much quicker US ubuntu package mirrors.<br /><br />Even without an opcode cache installed, a little testing with http_load indicates that the new system is maybe 10 times faster than my dreamhost shared hosting.  This is encouraging.</p>

<p>AFAICT, there is no OS X-native <a href="http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html" target="" title="">cachegrind</a> file visualization app for OS X.  <strong>THIS BLOWS ASS</strong>.  Right now I&#8217;m on hour 5 of compiling shit from <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/" target="" title="">Fink</a> to get <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/" target="" title="">KCacheGrind</a> installed, and even then I have to run that shit in the XWindows env.  Turdly.<br /><br />I&#8217;m sorta kicking around the idea of writing one of my own in RealBasic, which would be handy because it would be cross-platform out of the box.  Thoughts?</p>

That little annoyance took me about 2 hours to track &amp; fix. Not to mention that XFree didn&#8217;t compile so I had to switch to x.org.</p>

<p>So yeah, we need a native kcachegrind. I&#8217;m willing to take a shot at it with RealBasic, once I figure out what functionality it should have, once I actually get kcachegrind running. Hopefully soon.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Darwin ports (or Mac ports) appears to be no better than Fink. Both massive overkill when you just want one binary. 90 minutes of building and half a gigabyte under /opt for it to bomb out on libtiff because my XCode version isn&#8217;t new enough by one minor version, even though the gcc version is fine. It pulled down a <em>lot</em> of stuff that&#8217;s already on the system by default, or has an equivalent. e.g. it&#8217;s building sed, perl, mesa, python, etc, all for kcachegrind! It was quicker to download and install Fedora under VirtualBox and use the linux kcachegrind binary from yum! Not impressed.</p>

<p>Another web-based option is Carica CacheGrind:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccg/</p>

<p>Like webgrind you can bank on httpd (if you&#8217;re using apache) to run at about 95% CPU usage for a good long while if you&#8217;re parsing large cachegrind files (as I am&#8230;).</p>

<p>MacCallGrind is much faster, but could use more &#8220;goodies.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m leaving for Portland tomorrow.  Quite nervous &#8212; I&#8217;m not a big traveller, and this is the first flight I&#8217;ve had in two years.  I know it will go well, but I haven&#8217;t yet crossed the threshold from anxiety to confidence that I will inevitably breech once the flight takes off.<br /><br />We got our <a href="http://www.charm-school.com/">Charm School</a> t-shirts in the mail today, just in time to wear to the convention.

<p>A couple notes for those who are, like me, trying to run <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/"><span>Symfony</span> </a>on <a href="http://php.net"><span>PHP</span>5</a> in <span><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a></span>:</p>

<ul> <li>You&#8217;ll need to make sure that <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.info.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc">magic_quotes_<span>gpc</span></a> is disabled.&#xA0; It should be anyway, but I believe it defaults to &#8220;on.&#8221;</li> <li>You need to <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/forum/index.php/m/3955/#msg_3955">add &#8220;reflection&#8221; to the <span>Gentoo</span> <span>useflags</span></a> for <span>dev</span>-<span>lang</span>/<span>php</span>.&#xA0; This functionality seems to be used by the <span>symfony</span> <span>CLI</span> <span>app</span> to build the propel models/<span>sql</span>/do inserts.</li> </ul>

<p>I&#8217;ll add more notes as I come across them.<br /> <br /></p>

<p><strong>Update: official universal builds <a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/archives/os-x/new-builds-of-scplugin-available-including-universal-binaries/">are now available</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Raf. wrote it to let me know that he&#8217;s created an Intel binary of <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/">SCPlugin</a>, the Finder plugin that enables SVN access</p>

<blockquote>Hi Ed,

I’ve compiled an Intel version of the plugin (I noticed some comments on your blog <a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/archives/os-x/binary-build-of-scplugin/"> requesting Intel versions</a>)

Please find the file at: <a href="http://studiofunk.com.au/downloads/SCPlugin-Intel.zip">http://studiofunk.com.au/downloads/SCPlugin-Intel.zip</a>

<blockquote><p>It was truly one of the most astounding sports moments we can remember; like many Americans, we struggled to come up with an American sports equivalent, save for maybe Michael Jordan decking Byron Russell with two minutes left in Game 6. And even that wouldn’t quite be the same.</p>  </blockquote>

<p>Marco Materazzi, the italian chap who was on the recieving end of Zidane&#8217;s beatdown, seems to have a history of douchebaggery.  Courtesy of <a href="http://mutoni.blogspot.com/2006/07/head-hits-man-in-chest.html">Mutoni&#8217;s Musings:</a></p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImAjXdTKfjg&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmutoni%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F07%2Fhead%2Dhits%2Dman%2Din%2Dchest%2Ehtml">Video 1</a><br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HblsV-urHg&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmutoni%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2006%2F07%2Fhead%2Dhits%2Dman%2Din%2Dchest%2Ehtml">Video 2</a><br /> <p>Seems like a total douchebag to me. It&#8217;s really too bad Zidane&#8217;s head didn&#8217;t do more damage.</p>  </blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="http://mutoni.blogspot.com/2006/07/head-hits-man-in-chest.html#c115254435056899274">a comment on the post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For what it&#8217;s worth, in Brazil the TV show Fant&#xE1;stico managed to capture what Materazzi said to Zidande before the headbutt. He called Zidane&#8217;s sister a prostitute twice, and then called Zidane some &#8220;very strong curse word&#8221; that couldn&#8217;t be repeated. Not that this explains it. The only person who understands why it happened is Zidane, and perhaps his psychologist.</p>  </blockquote>

<p>Grow up and stop being such a goddamn hater.  Fireworks are fun if you allow yourself to enjoy them, as are cookouts and having fun with friends and family.  Yes, of course some people will behave like asses &#8212; this is not a new thing, this is not only in your neighborhood, this is not because of George Bush, this is not exclusive to the United States.  If you have better things to be doing, go do them and don&#8217;t blog about how much you hate what others enjoy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve given Opera tries here and there when new versions came out, but the newly-released <a href="http://opera.com">Opera 9</a> is <em>really</em> nice.  It&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> fast (much faster than FF on Windows, and appears to be faster than Safari on my iBook G4), has lots of useful features, some great tab handling ideas (multiple undos on closed tabs!!!!!), etc.  PLUS&#8230;. I&#8217;ve seen nary a rendering quirk.  The speed of it is a godsend when dealing with myspace promo crap, especially being able to toggle off images, plugins, and extra styling.  Oh, and did I mention it used orders of magnitude less memory than my Firefox install (which has several extensions installed, of course)?  There are lots of other features too, some extremely useful (almost everything is searchable, including your history), some not so much (did we need another widget standard?)<br /><br />It&#8217;s nice.  I&#8217;m going to give this a serious shot as my main browser.  Firebug on Firefox still is a killer HTML/CSS/JS debug tool that will keep me from ditching FF altogether, but for day to day use I can see myself using this.</p>

<p>Our internal CRUD app framework uses DB_DataObject as its data access layer, and DB_DO is in turn built on top of the <a target="_blank" href="http://pear.php.net/package/DB/">Pear_DB</a> layer.  Pear_DB has <a target="_blank" href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-sequences.php">a special sequence system</a> that works great out of the box with MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT keys, but it needs a little fiddling to play nice with PostgreSQL&#8217;s SERIAL metatype.  Basically, if you don&#8217;t tweak the sequence stuff a bit, Pear_DB won&#8217;t be able to retrieve the next ID # in the sequence.  This is an ignorable problem for single-table situations, but can cause problems (including data loss) with many-to-many relationships and other more complex cases.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get the Pear_DB sequences to play nice with your PostgreSQL sequences is to redefine the <tt>sequenceKey()</tt> method in your DB_DataObject-extending class:</p>

<pre class="code">class Otacon_Contact extends DB_DataObject 
{
     [...]

    /* the code above is auto generated do not remove the tag below */
    ###END_AUTOCODE

    /* this is required to get PEAR DB sequences working properly */
    function sequenceKey() { return array('contact_id', false, 'contact_contact_id_seq'); }

     [...]
}

</pre>

<p>In the example above, <tt>contact_id</tt> is the primary_key of the table, and <tt>contact_contact_id_seq</tt> is the sequence that <tt>contact_id</tt> gets its next value from.  This makes the Pear_DB sequence stuff to query this sequence to get the next value for your primary key, and you should be golden.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/39241541@N00/170016368"><br />  <img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/170016368_cbe12036d3_m.jpg" alt="Parallels Desktop is Pretty Awesome" /><br /></a><br /> <br /></p>

<p>Running <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio">Zend Studio</a> 5.2 in WinXP within <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels Desktop</a> on my 20&#8221; iMac Core Duo (1.5GB RAM).&#xA0; It runs pretty nicely, and since it&#8217;s a crapshoot getting the <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio">ZDE</a> installed on an Intel Mac, quite handy.</p>

<p>Parallels Desktop has gotten better since the last time I tried it.&#xA0; Seems more stable, and has added some handy features, like automatically adding a network share on your OS X host to allow you to map it as a drive in Windows.&#xA0; CD/DVD handling seems to work better now too, although I have only tried reading, not writing disks.<br /> </p>

<p>I really highly recommend an Intel Mac for anyone who&#8217;s interested in running OS X and Windows (even for midlevel gaming).&#xA0; I&#8217;ve been extremely happy with this purchase.&#xA0; If <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a> and/or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> come out with host apps for their virtualization systems, it&#8217;s gonna be utterly killer.<br /> </p>

<p>I had to drag this photo from my flickr photostream in the main flock windows &#8212; it looks like I couldn&#8217;t take a photo from, say, my Desktop or iPhoto.  I hope that changes in the future.<br /> </p>

<p>I will be attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a> in Portland, OR.  I&#8217;ll be flying in the evening of July 25th, and leaving the morning of July 29th.  I&#8217;m rather excited, because this time I will actually know some of the people attending/speaking at the event, and I think there will be a lot of opportunities to meet cool people, trade ideas, and talk to folks about <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</a> and the <a href="http://phpsec.org">PHP Security Consortium</a>.  If you&#8217;re going to OSCON and want to meet up, let me know!</p>

<p>This episode of Futurama I recorded on Sunday for Griffin (he likes it, I like it, and it has a low level of wildly inappropriate humor for an animated show we both like), and they not only used Black Flag&#8217;s &#8220;TV Party&#8221; during a montage, but also sang a cast version of the song over the credits.  Goddamn that&#8217;s cool.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/141258.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/141258.html</a></em></p>

<p>Ya know, I loved Casino, but she is just batshit crazy.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In a bizarre explanation she tells this story, according to Contact Music UK:<br /><br />&#8220;I was in the store the other day and I watched a young girl trying on clothes, showing her abdomen.<br /><br />&#8220;Her mother was trying to talk to her about not being inappropriately luring. I said, &#8216;Gee that would look much nicer with a camisole under.&#8217; &#8220;Her mother walked away, and I said to the girl, &#8216;I&#8217;d like to give you a two-minute conversation about sex.&#8217; &#8220;Young people talk to me about what to do if they&#8217;re being pressed for sex? I tell them (what I believe): oral sex is a hundred times safer than vaginal or anal sex.<br /><br />&#8220;If you&#8217;re in a situation where you cannot get out of sex, offer a blow job. I&#8217;m not embarrassed to tell them.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>Damn this rules:<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>PRESS RELEASE &#8212; NBC&#8217;s hit comedy &#8220;The Office&#8221; (Thursdays, 9:30 - 10:00pm ET) goes digital with ten, original stand-alone webisodes premiering on NBC.com this summer. The serialized arc will star the accounting staff of the Dunder Mifflin paper company in an edge-of-your-ergonomically-designed-seat whodunit.<br /><br />When the Dunder Mifflin accountants &#8212; Angela (Angela Kinsey), Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar (Oscar Nunez) &#8212; discover that $3000 is missing from the Scranton office, no one is above suspicion, as the crack team of numbers crunchers tries to solve the mystery before turning on each other. Rainn Wilson, Melora Hardin, Phyllis Smith, Kate Flannigan, Leslie David Baker and David Denman also star. </blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>According to a post by narf2006, a user who is said to be very credible on the &#8220;WinXP on Mac&#8221; forums and has been diligently hacking away since the challenge started, the magic has officially happened and he has submitted his super secret process to the owners of the site to review.</strong> His proof offered up in the thread, however, is a Flickr set of photos (some better than others) of what appears to be Windows XP (will the real WinXP please stand up?) on what we assume to be an Intel iMac.<br /><br />Of course, immediate reaction tends to be &#8220;zomg Photochop lol!&#8221; And I won&#8217;t say that that wasn&#8217;t my initial reaction either. However, upon further inspection of the currently available evidence, there may be more to this rumor than mad chops. A post titled &#8220;Mission Accomplished - twice almost&#8221; on the Windows on Mac blog appears to indicate that narf2006&#8217;s processes are (almost) reproducible <strong>and there is even a thread on the forums now asking for testers—three for MacBook Pros, three for iMacs, and three for Mac minis.</strong><br /><br /></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=3585&amp;p=3">This shit</a> is my new sacred text:</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="http://funkatron.com/external/lj/dannymanic~kids.jpg" align="right" />
Jesus Christ, kids these days are such amazingly stupid little pieces of trash. It used to be that dressing up like a weirdo hipster entailed some kind of risk: you’d get called a queer at school, you’d get laughed at at the mall, and your dad would tell you to get a haircut and wipe that makeup off your face (whether you were a boy or a girl). Nowadays, hipsterism is the new normalcy, and these little sons of bitches are dressing up like ugly little bastardizations of styles worn by daring morons ten and twenty years ago.</blockquote>

<p><br clear="all" />
[&#8230;]</p>

<blockquote><img src="http://funkatron.com/external/lj/dannymanic~trl.jpg" align="left" />And can you believe what these assholes are listening to? Avenged Sevenfold? My Chemical Romance? Now they’ve got plenty of this bland, diluted pap music to go along with their bland, diluted pap outfits. If your little brother or sister listens to this shit, punch him or her swiftly and directly in the nose and then take the little shit directly to the record store.</blockquote>

<p>For a while now I&#8217;ve not been able to connect to the Purdue campus LDAP server from Thunderbird.  Today I got a bit more determined to figure out the issue, and discovered after about 5 hours that Thunderbird is just fucked in the following situation:</p>

<p>1) You are running WinXP
2) You have the Windows IPv6 stack installed
3) You try to connect to an LDAP server from the Thunderbird Address Book</p>

<p><a href="http://lair.moria.org/blog/entry/Work/Thunderbird_windowsXP_ipv6_and_LDAP_directories.txt" target="_blank">This guy</a> does a better job of explaining it than I ever could, and I only half understood what the fuck was going on anyway, but nevertheless, this is <i>beyond gay</i>.  All the other apps with LDAP server query functionality (like Ye Olde Windows Address Book) work fine.  I actually ended up installing Windump on my machine, and saw that while every other app connected to the LDAP server fine, Thunderbird&#8217;s packets went off on a fucking trip through Singapore and got sold into sex slavery.</p>

<p>Anyway, the workaround &#8212; until the Thunderbird guys fix <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228439" target="_blank">this 2+ year old bug</a> &#8212; is to go into the properties for your ethernet device and uninstall Microsoft Version 6 TCP/IP (or whatever they call it).  I guess I wasn&#8217;t using it anyway&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will become the first law enforcement agency to outfit cars with a device that propels and sticks a Global Positioning System (GPS) onto a fleeing car.<br /><br />The department will mount the StarChase LLC device in the grill of some squad cars in the fall. &#8220;Officers in the car would control a green lazar light, similar to an aiming device that fixes on your target,&#8221; said LAPD Lieutenant Paul Vernon on Friday. &#8220;A small dart-like device is propelled from the officer&#8217;s car.&#8221;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contradicting predictions by commentators that Brokeback Mountain would not attract ticket buyers in red-state strongholds like Montana, the film has actually performed strongly in many of those areas, distributor Focus Features has maintained. (Fox News commentator John Gibson remarked: &#8220;I think most people do not want to go into a darkened room with a tub of popcorn and munch away watching two guys get it on.&#8221; His colleague Bill O&#8217;Reilly has opined that the film has received critical praise because the media &#8220;want to mainstream homosexual conduct.&#8221; And he predicted, &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to go see the gay cowboys in Montana.&#8221;) However, the online magazine Salon today (Thursday) quoted the manager of the Wilma Theater in Missoula as saying that the film grossed $33,006 in its first four weekends there &#8212; &#8220;one of our best starts for a movie we&#8217;ve ever had.&#8221; In the conservative town of Kalispell, the film opened last Friday with $3,656. In the town of Whitefish, it took in $2,312 and beat out the three top national draws, including the No. 1 film, Big Momma&#8217;s House 2. Salon indicated that the film is also a hit in Great Falls, Bozeman, and Helena, where it also opened at No. 1.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />You know why?  Because it&#8217;s not about two flaming queers smoking meth, throwing on cowboy hats and teabagging each other.  It&#8217;s a sad, romantic story about unfinished love and fear and how it can haunt us to the day we die.  It&#8217;s not as if this movie makes out their relationship to be a super-awesome, healthy thing.  And maybe if folks like O&#8217;Reilly and Gibson weren&#8217;t such fucking assholes, they could but aside their homophobia and knee-jerk morality and see that, <em>even if they don&#8217;t think homosexuality is morally correct</em>.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/132480.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/132480.html</a></em></p>

<p>So lots of people are pooping their pants over <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml">Yojimbo</a>, this new personal info organization app from BareBones.  I&#8217;ve started using it, and it is pretty cool, but I&#8217;ve run into a bit of an issue: it doesn&#8217;t like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> 2 files.  Try to drag one in, and you get no love.  I guess this is what they mean by the following:</p>

<blockquote>Store <i>almost</i> anything in Yojimbo&mdash;text, rich text, images, PDFs, even serial numbers and passwords</blockquote>

<p>(my emphasis)</p>

<p>Some may wonder why I&#8217;m still running OO v2 when I think <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> has had v3.5 out for about a hundred years.  That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m lazy, and I actually like v2 a bit better - it&#8217;s simpler, and I like the way it looks.  Probably it&#8217;s just inertia, though, and I&#8217;d like v3 better if I just used it.</p>

<p>Dude, I <em>looked</em> at the schedule on Tivo Tuesday night, and I didn&#8217;t see the new episode of the Shield listed.  Now I look tonight on FX, and it&#8217;s repeating.  WTF?  Bastards.  Anyway, I&#8217;m season passed now, so it should be all good.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t mention before, but I got a 40hr Series 2 Tivo as a gift about a week ago, and I&#8217;m absolutely loving it.  I bought a USB-&gt;Ethernet adapter and have it hooked into my home network, so I can dump recordings off to PCs and stuff like that.  It&#8217;s basically fucking awesome, and works <em>so</em> well out of the box that I&#8217;m utterly in love.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://funkatron.livejournal.com/131179.html">http://funkatron.livejournal.com/131179.html</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284">Fascinating story on the PC gaming phenomenon in South Korea</a>:<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>“So this guy has a lot of fans?” I say, knowing the answer but nevertheless incredulous.<br /><br />“Hundreds of thousands in his fan club,” says Yang. “Impossible to track the number of people who watch him play.”<br /><br />Impossible, because the man on the stage is on Korean television almost every day. He is about to sit down and play what is close to becoming Korea’s national sport: Starcraft. His name is Lee Yunyeol, or in game [RED]NaDa Terran. He is The Champion. Last year his reported earnings were around $200,000. He plays a seven year-old RTS for fame and fortune and to many Koreans he is an idol. Every night over half a million Koreans log on to Battlenet and make war in space, many of them with dreams of becoming like Yunyeol. But his skill is almost supernatural. Few people who play all day long will be able to claim a fraction of his split-second timing and pitiless concentration. Practicing eight hours a day, Yunyeol’s methods and tactics are peerless. Well, almost peerless. In fact there are two or three other players who command similar salaries. They might not hold the crown now, and one of them will probably take it from him soon, but for now at least, Yunyeol is king.</blockquote>

<p><strong>It appears that development of SCPlugin has resumed, despite the fact that the news page has not been updated in over two years.  The project&#8217;s <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents &amp; Files page</a> offers downloads of versions as new as December 9, 2006, including an &#8220;experimental&#8221; Universal Binary build of SCPlugin.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to test this yet, but this is certainly encouraging.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Older information follows&#8230;</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Despite the fact that some folks have gotten it to compile, Intel builds of this plugin have proven to be <em>extremely</em> buggy.  At this point I have switched to using <a href="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/">svnX</a> for all of my svn needs on OS X.  The best I can recommend would be to contact the SCPlugin project maintainers listed at <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/">scplugin.tigris.org</a> and request that effort be put into Intel compatibility.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/">SCPlugin</a>, a contextual menu plugin for the OS X Finder, is pretty cool.  The official distro is only via source, tho, which isn&#8217;t super handy for a lot of folks.  So I built the plugin and zipped that bad boy up for your enjoyment:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://funkatron.com/downloads/SCFinderPlugin.zip">Download (2.6MB zip)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Merry Xmas!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Raf. has built what promises to be an Intel-compatible version of SCPlugin:</p>

<blockquote>Hi Ed,

I&#8217;ve compiled an Intel version of the plugin (I noticed some comments
on your blog requesting Intel versions: <a href="http://funkatron.com/wp/archives/os-x/binary-build-of-scplugin/">http://funkatron.com/wp/archives/os-x/binary-build-of-scplugin/</a>)

Please find the file at:
<a href="http://studiofunk.com.au/downloads/SCPlugin-Intel.zip">http://studiofunk.com.au/downloads/SCPlugin-Intel.zip</a>

You can <a href="http://funkatron.com/downloads/SCPlugin-Intel.zip">mirror</a> the file if you like and let some of your readers know
with an updated article.</blockquote>

For starters make gave me a checksum.md5 error and xcode barfed about 10 errors as well when I tried compiling.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tried your binary yet, but I am hoping it works as the older binary on the scplugin site crashes on install. Too bad the scplugin team had their &#8220;real life&#8221; intrude, this looked like a very promising tool.</p>

<p>For the folks trying to get into the repository, there is some note on the site mentioning that there is no longer a password (technically a blank password) needed for CVS access, and this apparently goes for SVN access as well. In any case I was able to get in and download the trunk directory using username: &#8220;guest&#8221; and a blank password field.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s a new release of SCPlugin available at the site, release 0.7.  This release is a Universal Binary (Intel and PPC), includes a proper installer, and implements the complete work flow for most users.  New features include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can provide your login info during commit &#8212; no more need for a separate command-line client for this!</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, no need for a command-line client at all: we&#8217;re now building against the libraries themselves, rather than running the external client, so things are faster and more reliable</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, no need for a separate SVN installation at all: we bundle Subversion as a Framework inside the plug-in</p></li>
<li><p>Login info securely cached in the OS X Keychain</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pop on over and give it a try!  http://scplugin.tigris.org</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There had been videogame systems before the Atari 2600, but the 2600 was the system that appealed to the most people and had the best selection of games. Kinda like how computers and the internet didn’t take off big-time until Windows 95 came out. (and you anti-Microsoft people know it’s true) However, Atari wasn’t a HUGE hit right off the bat. In fact, some say that it would have died a quick death had it not been for a technical anomaly in the system</p>

The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites an 1877 reference in an unpublished private letter of the painter and sculptor known for Western themes, Frederick Remington: &#8220;Don&#8217;t send me any more women or any more dudes,&#8221; he told a correspondent who was sending him sketches. &#8220;Dude&#8221; first appeared in print in 1878. The word made the rounds of New York City slang of ca 1883, referring to a fastidiously sharp dresser, affecting sophistication. This is what the late 18th century British would have referred to as a &#8220;dandy&#8221;, which brings us to the compelling theory that &#8220;dude&#8221; was actually derived from the &#8220;Doodle&#8221; of the song &#8220;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8221;.<br /><br />    <blockquote>Yankee Doodle went to town, A-riding on a pony.<br />    Stuck a feather in his cap, and called it &#8220;macaroni&#8221;<br /><br />    Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle Dandy<br />    Mind the music and the step, and with the girls be handy</blockquote><br /><br />The song was actually written by the British as an insult to the colonists during the French and indian war&#8212;the British soldiers have been decked out in their royal uniforms, and the colonists, or yankees, in rags and coonskin caps. So &#8220;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8221; was a mocking take on colonial lack of sophistication. A &#8220;macaroni&#8221; was a British slang term for French or Italian attire, thus a man who had travelled to Paris or Rome, and adopted their style, affecting a high level of sophistication, was the definitive dandy. Yankee Doodle is so unsophisticated that he when sticks the feather in his cap and calls it &#8220;macaroni&#8221;, he believes he is being fashionable. The British popularized the song during the Revolutionary War, but the colonists in their victory eventually embraced the song as their own, showing pride in their lack of affected sophistication</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, Eichenwald helped convince Berry to quit porn and quit drugs. He found him a lawyer. The lawyer, in turn, persuaded federal prosecutors to give Berry immunity for serving as the state&#8217;s witness.<br /><br />What extraordinary intervention! The analogies aren&#8217;t perfect, but imagine a Times reporter encountering an 18-year-old who had been thrust into the illicit drug business at 13 as a consequence of his neglectful family and unscrupulous dealers? Would he help the young man leave the drug trade and find him a lawyer at a Washington firm who is &#8220;a former federal prosecutor,&#8221; as Eichenwald did Berry? Not likely. Would a Times reporter extend similar assistance to an 18-year-old female prostitute? An 18-year-old fence? A seller of illegal guns? No way.</blockquote>

<p>Really interesting article on Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Zope, Java, and EJB.  It covers a lot of ground, but deals with stuff I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about lately: what direction to follow as a web app developer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312">The departure of the hyper-enthusiasts</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Java hyper-enthusiasts have left the building, leaving a significant contingent of Java programmers behind, blinking in the bright lights without the constant drumbeat of boosterism.

But the majority of programmers, who have been relatively quiet all this time, always knew that Java is a combination of strengths and weaknesses. These folks are not left with any feelings of surprise, but instead they welcome the silence, because it&#8217;s easier to think and work.

Where did the hyper-enthusiasts go? To Ruby, apparently.</blockquote>

<p>I especially appreciate his comments about Zope:</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;ve been bumping up against the problem of &#8220;but all I want to do is connect a database to the web&#8221; in Zope2 for several years now. Oh, it&#8217;s definitely something you can do, but unfortunately it&#8217;s past the knee of the &#8220;Z-shaped learning curve,&#8221; and is only trivial if you live and breathe Zope every day. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; Zope is an excellent system and incredibly powerful, and Zope3 may be much easier, but I&#8217;m out of steam. I have realized that on my site, I really just want to do a collection of simple things, and I don&#8217;t want to relearn Zope every time I want to accomplish something. So &#8212; sorry, Jim (Fulton, not Kirk) &#8212; I&#8217;m going to find something drop-dead simple to solve my drop-dead simple problems. Probably PHP5, which actually includes most of Java and C++ syntax, amazingly enough, and I wonder if that isn&#8217;t what made IBM adopt it.</blockquote>

<p>PHP5&#8217;s simplicity makes it perfect for writing (relatively) small apps &#8212; it&#8217;s a lightweight solution that lends itself to &#8220;dead-simple&#8221; problems.  I am kind of curious about Zope3, though &#8212; I closely examined Zope2 a few years back as a possibly solution for a departmental web system, but the learning curve was just way too steep to make up for the wins you got from it.</p>

<blockquote>Throughout the medical malpractice crisis, leading newspapers carried accounts of other obvious medical mistakes. Like the L.A. Times piece on Jesica and Jeanella, the accounts often linked the particular mistakes to the larger story about the extent of medical malpractice in U.S. health care. The report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, To Err Is Human, was a common source. That report summarized research showing that nearly 100,000 people die in the United States each year from medical mistakes—more than die from automobile and workplace accidents combined.<br /><br />Because of that research and reporting, public opinion is coming around to the view that, distressingly, Jesica’s and Jeanella’s problems are not unique; our health care system has a serious medical-injury problem. But at the same time, public opinion remains firmly anchored to the view that we have an explosion of what President George W. Bush calls “junk lawsuits” and that medical malpractice lawsuits contribute significantly to the high cost of health care in the United States.<br /><br />Stories like Jesica’s and Jeanella’s helped shift public opinion about medical malpractice only because they were linked to research and reporting that reframed medical malpractice as a public health problem. But their stories did not shift public opinion about medical malpractice lawsuits, because they were not linked to research and reporting that reframed malpractice lawsuits as a public good.</blockquote>

Add that it runs in 1/3 the time, using 1/3 the memory (making it essentially 10x faster for us) and that we can start taking advantage of other Postgres features, like data partitioning and partial indices in the near future, and you have the reason we decided to make the switch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For a moment it was as if the prosecutor rather than the president was standing up for the integrity of the nation and behaving as a patriot.<br /><br />Moreover, Fitzgerald made it clear that his inquiry was not yet over. His indictment reveals that it was not Libby — but a mysterious &#8220;Official A&#8221; — who gave Plame’s name to Novak. Libby, it transpired, had passed it to three other journalists, including Miller who had failed to make use of the information in print.<br /><br />Official A is widely believed to be Karl Rove, the president’s chief political adviser and a man widely known as &#8220;Bush’s brain&#8221;. Experts now believe that Fitzgerald, having charged Libby, could push him to expose Rove’s role in exchange for a more lenient sentence. That, say some, could open the door to Cheney being charged.<br /><br />If Libby comes to trial, Cheney is bound to have to take the stand as a witness. At the very least he will have to answer embarrassing questions about why he let Libby claim throughout the 22- month inquiry that he learnt of Plame’s identity only through reporters when Cheney himself had told Libby that Plame worked for the CIA.</blockquote>

<p>I fucking love CSS, but certain kinds of layouts are annoyingly difficult to do &emdash; and very doable in table-based approaches.  Since we sure as hell don&#8217;t wanna go down that road anymore, <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/">position is everything</a> is GOLD, JERRY.</p>

<blockquote>Pure CSS-based layouts have come a long way but they still have shortcomings [2] that fail to address certain design goals without compromising the true separation of content and presentation.

In short, the problematic design goals are these:

<strong>Total Layout Flexibility</strong>

That is, the ability to order columns logically in the source while displaying them in any order desired. For any number of columns.

<strong>Equal Height Columns</strong>

Or more accurately, equal height columns without having to rely on faux columns.

<strong>Vertical placement of elements across grids/columns</strong>

Designers face the choice of relying on elements being a particular height, resorting to tables or simply not bothering.</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m gonna lose all 1337 h4x0r rep my admitting that my fav editor is <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a>.  This is a remnant of using <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</a> as my preferred email program in college (and even today when I can only get in via SSH), which by default uses <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ucspubs/b103/">Pico</a> as its editor.  Nano is a Pico clone that has a &#8220;free as in freedom&#8221; license in the GPL, and adds some enhancements like regex searching and <strong>syntax coloring</strong>.</p>

<p>Yesterday I decided to delve back into developing syntax coloring stuff for Nano on our servers, and came up with a pretty decent setup for Apache conf files.  It includes special coloring for the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/directives.html">runtime config directives</a>.</p>

<p>To use this, make a text file in your home directory called <code>.nanorc</code> and paste the contents of this file into it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/archive/../../2005/10/13/rock-bottom-nbcws_n_8799.html" target="_blank">NBC/WSJ Poll: 2% Of African-Americans Give President Bush A Positive Rating</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>RUSSERT: And Matt, the most astounding number in this: 2 percent – just 2 percent - of African-Americans give George Bush a positive rating for his performance as President. The memories of Katrina very much in their minds.<br /><br />LAUER: Is that what this is all about? I mean, obviously that is just a startling number, 2 percent of African-Americans. Is this all about the aftermath of Katrina?<br /><br />RUSSERT: Well, the imagery of that along with the economy and fuel prices and Iraq, but that event, Matt, really did have a searing effect. George Bush and the Republican Party has tried very hard to reach out to African-American voters, but this is a very dramatic setback. <strong>I cannot find a pollster who can remember any President ever getting just 2 percent approval from African-Americans.</strong></blockquote>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9672058/" target="_blank">Bush approval dips below 40 percent</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>For the first time in the poll, Bush’s approval rating has sunk below 40 percent, while <strong>the percentage believing the country is heading in the right direction has dipped below 30 percent.</strong> In addition, a sizable plurality prefers a Democratic-controlled Congress, and just 29 percent think Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers is qualified to serve on the nation’s highest court.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/../../bob-burnett/playing-by-bush-rules_b_8788.html" target="_blank">Bob Burnett: Playing by Bush Rules</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Americans know a lot about Christianity as more than 80 percent identify with that religion. We understand that orthodox Christians do not lie, put their personal fortune above the common good, or believe that the ends justify the means. Proper Christians operate by the ethical equivalent of the Marques of Queensbury rules. Most believe that it’s not whether you win or lose but how you play the game.<br /><br />But George W. Bush plays by his own rules. As American watch this administration unravel – as the electorate begins to understand the folly of the Iraq occupation, the fantasy of homeland security, and the abandonment of governance in the pursuit of political gain – one wonders which realization will come first: Will it be that Bush the President is incapable of leading the U.S., or will it be that <strong>Bush the man doesn’t deserve to be called a Christian?</strong></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0921051school1.html"><strong>The Principal Lacked Principle</strong><br /><br />Booze, drug, sex scandal rocks educators at Ohio middle school</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Wedgewood Middle School educators drank booze during the school day, got kinky with each other in the boiler room bathroom, and spoke about where to score cocaine.</blockquote>

<p><br />[&#8230;]<br /></p>

<blockquote>Baker told investigators that last May she spotted Terry &#8220;in the Boiler room restroom pulling her pants down with the door open and [Koeller] went into the restroom and started kissing Abbi and doing other things.&#8221; Baker also said that on the last day of school in 2004, she observed Terry &#8220;doing a seductive dance&#8221; for Koeller in the principal&#8217;s office. Before she began gyrating, Terry had removed her shirt, &#8220;leaving herself in a bra only,&#8221; said Baker. The probe of the Wedgewood hijinks was aided by information provided by Terry&#8217;s estranged husband, who blamed Koeller for stealing his wife away from him. <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0921051school10.html">In a letter</a> to the executive director of Columbus&#8217;s school system, David Terry branded Koeller &#8220;an alcoholic, a drug abuser, a liar, and a wife stealer.&#8221; He noted that Koeller once told him that she smoked pot daily en route to school because &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand those kids.</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t generally agree with critics, but I like to use them for my purposes when I do.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2005-09-30#film4">Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDB.com</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In her review, Manohla Dargis in the New York Times compares Joss Whedon&#8217;s Serenity with George Lucas&#8217;s Star Wars: Episode III &#8212; Revenge of the Sith. Serenity comes out ahead. &#8220;Scene for scene,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;Serenity is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas&#8217;s recent screen entertainments. Mr. Whedon isn&#8217;t aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time.&#8221; Jan Stuart in Newsday makes a similar comparison, remarking: &#8220;George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Whedon. Serenity flies with sass and spirit, qualities that have been in palpably short supply in that Star Wars series since, well, Star Wars.&#8221; Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times also indicates that he had a good time watching the movie, writing: &#8220;Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire.&#8221; Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News notes that the movie appears to exist as a the final episode of Whedon&#8217;s canceled Firefly TV series and because the show&#8217;s fans &#8220;made the Firefly DVD set an unexpected best seller.&#8221; She adds: &#8220;Whedon&#8217;s sci-fi fantasies smartly parallel the serious issues we&#8217;re grappling with here on Earth, while his protagonists remain mordantly funny in the face of utter disaster. Like Star Trek before it, the outer-space setting is perfectly suited to a big budget&#8221; movie.</blockquote>

<p>I was tricked (and by tricked, I mean they waited until I updated my credit card info to buy some music from the iTMS, and then renewed my account immediately) into renewing my almost never used .Mac account.  I kinda dug it when they were doing stuff like releasing free software to .Mac users, but lately the only cool stuff we got as members were bandwidth limitations.  Poor.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I got the renewal notice, I decided to check up on whether or not anything mildly cool happened with .Mac lately.  Coincidentally, I renewed exactly at the same time they upped the storage to 1GB, added the &#8220;Groups&#8221; features, and released Backup 3 (because who would need backup software if you didn&#8217;t have an iDisk?)</p>

<p>I actually haven&#8217;t tried either yet, because I don&#8217;t see much use for making a group only accessible to other .Mac users, and Backup 2 sucked so deeply and tightly that I throw up a little every time it&#8217;s mentioned.  I don&#8217;t get why Apple didn&#8217;t just pay <a href="http://www.dantz.com/">Dantz</a> for a &#8220;lite&#8221; version of Retrospect , because as ass-backwards as the UI was the last time I tried it, it at least seemed to function.</p>

<p>Anyway, not surprisingly, reports on MacInTouch are that shit&#8217;s wonky with the .Mac groups.  First off:</p>

<blockquote>So somebody who creates a free .Mac ID and lets the .Mac trial expire can continue to participate fully in a .Mac group, but a paying user of an email-only account cannnot. Something is wrong with this picture. </blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s not so much &#8220;wonky&#8221; as &#8220;par for the course.&#8221;  Anyway, here&#8217;s some more dumb crap:</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;my Dad saw the invitation, looked at the &#8220;sign up for a free .Mac trial&#8221; page it sent him to, and closed the browser. When we later figured out that this was the only way to join, and that it wouldn&#8217;t cost money (as we had initially thought), he started up Firefox, went to www.mac.com and created a trial account. Of course, this new account couldn&#8217;t join the group until I sent it an invitation. Whups! If you don&#8217;t create your new .Mac ID directly from the invitation email, it isn&#8217;t connected to the group.</blockquote>

<p>Truly, the masters of user experience.</p>

<p>As for crap that&#8217;s broken in Backup 3:</p>

<blockquote>I run Backup and select Restore and follow the appropriate prompts and insert the CD and the Restore job appears to run but it takes only about a third of a second and then declares it was &#8220;successful.&#8221; But there are no new files on the destination machine. I&#8217;ve tried restoring to the iTunes folder, and also restoring to an alternate location, same result. No error message, but nothing is restored, either.</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;and&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>I made a 10-disc CD backup of my iTunes library and tonight had to do a restore. The same thing happened to me as did to him: after following Backup&#8217;s procedure, it tells me I had a &#8220;successful&#8221; backup and nothings there.</blockquote>

<p>Man, that is awesome.  I feel better about my renewal already.</p>

<p>For utter shite in IT journalism, it&#8217;s hard to beat <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/AViuO5r1twGnhR/Windows-Vista-The-Final-Countdown-Begins.xhtml">this turd</a> that escaped from the bowels of Rob Enderle.  Nothing annoys me more than clearly debatable points that are presented with no evidence, and Robbie&#8217;s article is filled with gems like this:</p>

<blockquote><b>IE improvements are broad and easily eclipse those by Firefox and Netscape</b>, but remember this is still beta code so these competitors do have time to respond. Web applications are now more effectively sand-boxed so they can&#8217;t do damage and IE extends tabs to include full preview windows. In addition, there has been a massive improvement in resistance to phishing which leads me to favor the Netscape browser for individuals. The new IE expands on the idea of tabs to provide real time views of the active pages.</blockquote>

<p>First off, I&#8217;d like to hear what improvements IE7 makes that &#8220;easily eclipse&#8221; those by Firefox and its brethren.  The ones I&#8217;ve heard about are things where IE7 is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">catching up</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx">to Gecko&#8217;s rendering engine</a>, or adding features <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/14/466186.aspx"> that</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/06/461675.aspx">have</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/02/460115.aspx">been</a> in Firefox and/or related browsers <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/08/02/446280.aspx">for</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/16/417732.aspx">quite some time</a>.  Now I&#8217;m not gonna deny that there is some cool work going on in IE7 in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/20/471975.aspx">terms</a> of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/09/463204.aspx">security</a>, but it&#8217;s interesting that much of capability is only available on Vista, because XP &mdash; even SP2 &mdash; is fundamentally flawed when it comes to user permissions.  IE7 will continue to be a successful attack vector with all pre-Vista versions of Windows, even assuming that protected mode is flawlessly implemented.  And it sure as hell isn&#8217;t the case that XP users will be falling over themselves to upgrade, let alone the numerous folks who are still running 2000 Pro (the folks who are running stuff from the Win95/98 codebase have been fucked for years, so there&#8217;s really no point talking about them, even though they still are a substantial percentage of Windows users).</p>

<p>One thing that looks interesting the <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/09/microsoft_atlas_2.html">Atlas web app dev system</a>.  Basically it&#8217;s MS&#8217; Ajax library, and among other cool stuff can integrate with WPF/E, a portable subset of the new Vista UI layer.  When I say portable, I mean it, because at PDC they <a href="http://galbraiths.org/blog/?p=12">showed a demo of it running on a Mac in Safari</a>.  While the issue of a Firefox plugin hasn&#8217;t been addressed, it doesn&#8217;t sound like it would be to terribly difficult for a third party to do (at least on Windows).  So yeah, neat shit, but <b>it&#8217;s not specific to IE7</b>.</p>

<p>Robbie talks a lot about how Apple needs to take Vista seriously.  Yes, it does, for sure.  But Robbie seems to think Vista is a serious threat to Apple &mdash; as serious as Win95 was to the Apple of 1994:</p>

<blockquote>Apple will have to improve its game sharply to compete. However, given the strength at the back end, strength that Apple has never had, the exposure now goes well beyond Apple&#8217;s available resources. This means Apple will have to partner to avoid what may be the most damaging competitive threat the company has ever faced. While possible, Apple&#8217;s one prevailing weakness has been their inability to partner and unless that changes we should be able to call the outcome of this competition relatively easily &#8212; and it isn&#8217;t positive for Apple.</blockquote>

<p>I call bullshit on that, though, because of something Rob points out:</p>

<blockquote>Apple is again growing with the market and, unlike 1994, is dominant in an emerging market &#8212; digital music players.</blockquote>

<p>Mac fans don&#8217;t really like admitting this, but the <b>only</b> reason Apple is totally kicking ass lately is because of the iPod.  Apple is in an enviable position as the clear leader in the market with few companies with the resources <i>and</i> expertise necessary to mount a real attack against them.  It&#8217;s a huge, publicly prominent position.</p>

<p>What this means is that, for the moment, Apple&#8217;s computer sales are kinda gravy.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if they only have 3% of the market, because their massive media influence gives that 3% a lot more sway.  So even if Vista steals a couple tenths of a percentage point from the Mac market, <i>it doesn&#8217;t matter</i>.  Apple doesn&#8217;t need them to <i>thrive</i>, let alone survive.</p>

<p>Plus, Rob doesn&#8217;t even <i>mention</i> Google, the company that MS is surely most worried about right now.  For an article dealing with how Vista and Office 12 position the company against all of its competitors, ignoring the big G is ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>The news got even worse: Longhorn was irredeemable because Microsoft engineers were building it just as they had always built software. Throughout its history, Microsoft had let thousands of programmers each produce their own piece of computer code, then stitched it together into one sprawling program. Now, Mr. Allchin argued, the jig was up. Microsoft needed to start over.</blockquote>

<p>This was a pretty interesting article, and I imagine a more detailed examination of the change in software practices would be pretty interesting.  It&#8217;s easy to hate the Microsoft, but competition is a good thing, kids, and MS getting better at what they do will push Apple/Google/et al to push back harder.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s horseshit.  Finding certain aesthetics that happen to be present in people from a particular part of the globe is by no means racist.  That&#8217;s why you used the word &#8220;vaguely:&#8221; because you can&#8217;t back up your claim with a real argument.  If we take a look at the variety of definitions offered on Answers.com for racism, we find:</p>

<p>&#8220;The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial worldview-the ideology that humans are divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called “races,” that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural behavioral features, and that some “races” are innately superior to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Racism is a belief in the moral or biological superiority of one race or ethnic group over another or others.&#8221;</p>

<p>That I often find petite asian women attractive has nothing to do with believing that 1) the concept of race actually exists, 2) physical attributes correspond to character attributes, or 3) that some &#8220;races&#8221; are superior to others.</p>

<p>As for being a cliche, I&#8217;m unconcerned whether some of my preferences are shared by others.  The fact that you&#8217;d summarize a person so quickly based on so little information is intellectually lazy, ignorant, and sad.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of comment spam lately, so I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a>, which takes a different approach to spam blocking:</p>

<blockquote>Bad Behavior was designed and built by watching actual spambots which harvested email addresses, posted comment spam, and used fake referrers. By logging their entire HTTP requests and comparing them to HTTP requests of legitimate users, it is possible to detect most spambots.</blockquote>

<p>Let me know if you have any problems.  I&#8217;ll post some impressions after I&#8217;ve used it a bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1104/110304cm1.htm">www.GovExec.com - How FEMA delivered Florida for Bush (11/3/04)</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>In 2004, George W. Bush and FEMA left little room for error. Not long after Hurricane Charley first made landfall on Aug. 13, Bush declared the state a federal disaster area to release federal relief funds. Less than two days after Charley ripped through southwestern Florida, he was on the ground touring hard-hit neighborhoods.<br /><br />Bush later made a handful of other Florida visits to review storm-related damage, but the story on the ground was not Bush&#8217;s hand-holding. Rather, it was FEMA&#8217;s performance.<br /><br />Charley hit on a Friday. With emergency supply trucks pre-positioned at depots for rapid, post-storm deployment, the agency was able to deliver seven truckloads of ice, water, cots, blankets, baby food and building supplies by Sunday. On Monday, hundreds of federal housing inspectors were on the ground, and FEMA already had opened its first one-stop disaster relief center.</blockquote>

<p>I did a seminar today on web app security.  I&#8217;ve got the slides up over here:</p>

<p><a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~coj/">http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~coj/</a></p>

<p>The video should be back to us next week.  I&#8217;ll post it then.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time.  I had seen these seminars go 1:20 before, but I guess this year they have another class in the same room, so I only had 50 minutes <em>firm</em>.  I really had to rush through everything.  It was pretty broad, and a lot more depth could have been given.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/5/225729/7487">Daily Kos: The Buck Stops Here</a></strong><br /><br />Please read the whole thing.  I&#8217;ve taken choice bits, but the explanations are critical to understanding the failure of the executive branch.<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Below, I&#8217;ve excerpted critical parts of the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interapp/editorial/editorial_0566.xml">United States National Response Plan</a>, as published in December 2004</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>First and foremost, let me stress that this document is essentially a contract with American citizens.  &#8220;By signing this letter of agreement, Federal departments and agencies&#8221; commit to implementing the plan.  It is signed by Donald Rumsfeld, Tom Ridge, Tommy Thompson, Porter Gross, John Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Robert Mueller, Michael Powell, and several others.  THIS is the real &#8220;Contract With America.&#8221;  It is the Federal Government&#8217;s promise that it will execute the National Response Plan properly. </blockquote>

<p><br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>While the state and local officials then still have to try and implement their plans and coordinate with the feds, it is crystal clear that the NRP recognizes that when, say, a hurricane comes and wipes your city off the map, <strong>it is the President and his administration which MUST respond proactively.</strong></blockquote>

<p><br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Again, for three days before the hurricane hit, President Bush had the authority to direct Rumsfeld to deploy troops.  <strong>Under the NRP, a formal request by the Governor is not necessary in these conditions.</strong>  For three days before Katrina hit, and for FIVE Days afterwards, the President always had the authority to send in thousands of troops.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Under that section, the plan provides that:<br /><blockquote>&#8221;<strong>Standard procedures regarding requests for assistance</strong> may be expedited, or under extreme circumstances, <strong>suspended</strong> in the immediate aftermath of an event of catastrophic magnitude.&#8221; (NRP, 44)</blockquote><br />Yes, you read that right.  This theory that the Federal Government has to sit on its ass and WAIT for Governors and Mayors to tearfully beg for assistance and issue S.O.S is pure fiction.  The government has signed off on a promise to be PROACTIVE<br /><br />And what does the plan include under the federal proactive response to a catastrophic event? <strong>The &#8220;pre-identification of Federal assets and capabilities&#8221; and the &#8220;strategic location of pre-identified assets for rapid deployment&#8221;</strong> (NRP, 44).</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Keith Olbermann, for reminding the nation of what this administration has tried so hard to make us forget: that the buck stops with them.<br /><br /><a href="http://media.putfile.com/OlbermannSwings">http://media.putfile.com/OlbermannSwings</a><br /><br />(thanks <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=josienutter'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/josienutter/'><b>josienutter</b></a></span>)<br /><br />That is the black, poison heart of my disgust with George W Bush, his administration, and his kind: their unwillingness to ever admit fault.  Cowards bask in the glory of their achievements, and find others to blame for their failures.  Honorable men understand that with success comes failure, and accept their role in either with measured response.<br /><br />The halls of government in Washington are infested with cowards, even at the desk of the Oval Office.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t give a damn if our next president is republican, democrat, liberal, conservative, or anything in-between.  I just pray to God that he is an honorable man, because our country has never needed one more.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/118841.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/118841.html</a></em></p>

<blockquote>Who dropped the ball in New Orleans? The Department of Homeland Security website sheds some light:<br /><br /></blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;In the event of a terrorist attack, natural disaster or other large-scale emergency, the Department of Homeland Security will assume primary responsibility on March 1st for ensuring that emergency response professionals are prepared for any situation. This will entail providing a coordinated, comprehensive federal response to any large-scale crisis and mounting a swift and effective recovery effort.&#8221;<br />That&#8217;s pretty clear, no? When the question is asked, &#8220;Who should&#8217;ve saved the people of New Orleans from starvation, thirst, rape, disease, and death?&#8221; </blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/archives/2005/09/02/federal/">La Shawn Barber’s Corner » The Federal Response Has Been An Embarrassment</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Liberals hate George Bush, and no matter what he does, they’ll use anything and anyone to get at him. I don’t hate the man. <strong>I voted for him</strong>. I want him to succeed, but more than that, I want to be safe, feel safe, and I don’t. <strong>The federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina has been an epic and humiliating embarrassment.</strong></blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>I’m ashamed of this country and its bumbling leadership today. Bush and Co. are going to catch he** from all angles, including the race angle, and I hope they catch it good, too. Billions we spend, and all we have to show for it are four-day-old corpses on the side of the road, starving and injured people, and women and children being raped by animals who shouldn’t even be alive.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br /><strong><a href="http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BUSH_KATRINA?SITE=1010WINS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2005-09-02-14-10-02">Bush Tours Katrina Damage Amid Criticism</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Even Republicans were criticizing Bush and his administration for the sluggish relief effort. &#8220;I think it puts into question all of the Homeland Security and Northern Command planning for the last four years, because if we can&#8217;t respond faster than this to an event we saw coming across the Gulf for days, then why do we think we&#8217;re prepared to respond to a nuclear or biological attack?&#8221; said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Robinette asked the mayor about his conversation with President Bush:</em><br /><br />NAGIN: I told him we had an incredible crisis here and that his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice. And that I have been all around this city, and I am very frustrated because we are not able to marshal resources and we&#8217;re outmanned in just about every respect.</blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>WL: Do you believe that the president is seeing this, holding a news conference on it but can&#8217;t do anything until [Louisiana Gov.] Kathleen Blanco requested him to do it? And do you know whether or not she has made that request?<br /><br />NAGIN: I have no idea what they&#8217;re doing. But I will tell you this: You know, <strong>God is looking down on all this, and if they are not doing everything in their power to save people, they are going to pay the price</strong>. Because every day that we delay, people are dying and they&#8217;re dying by the hundreds, I&#8217;m willing to bet you. </blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>NAGIN: Well, did the tsunami victims request? Did it go through a formal process to request?<br /><br />You know, did the Iraqi people request that we go in there? Did they ask us to go in there? What is more important?<br /><br />And I&#8217;ll tell you, man, I&#8217;m probably going get in a whole bunch of trouble. I&#8217;m probably going to get in so much trouble it ain&#8217;t even funny. You probably won&#8217;t even want to deal with me after this interview is over.<br /><br />WWL: You and I will be in the funny place together.<br /><br />NAGIN: But we authorized $8 billion to go to Iraq lickety-quick. After 9/11, we gave the president unprecedented powers lickety-quick to take care of New York and other places. </blockquote>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Don&#8217;t tell me 40,000 people are coming here. They&#8217;re not here. It&#8217;s too doggone late. Now get off your asses and do something, and let&#8217;s fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country.</blockquote>

<p>The interview deals specifically with Gruber&#8217;s opinions on the OS X GUI.  Interesting stuff, esp. some of the info about the original Aqua demos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/interviewwithjohngruber">GUIdebook > Articles > Interview with John Gruber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I believe Jobs is mostly responsible for Apple&rsquo;s almost-entirely-arbitrary use of brushed metal windows. E.g. the decision to use brushed metal in Safari. I could be wrong &#8211; I have no sources or evidence to back that up. But my thinking is that Jobs sees the &ldquo;consistency,&rdquo; so to say, as stemming from his own aesthetic judgement. That&rsquo;s Jobs&rsquo;s gift: his taste, and his ability to motivate teams to meet his standards. So if he feels in his gut that, for example, Safari looks better with brushed metal windows, then he knows he&rsquo;s right, and that&rsquo;s the end of the debate. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the answer contradicts the Mac OS X Human Interface Guidelines.</blockquote>

<p>This was a really good article by <a href="http://www.3eige.com/">3EIGE</a> &#8212; very useful info for people who want to know more about how to do photo enhancement.</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=841">Editing your digital images without the mystery</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nearly all photo album applications can make basic image adjustments. Sometimes you need more than they can provide in order to clean up a digital image. In the first of a series of digital imaging guides, graphic artist Dave Girard introduces us to some basic image adjustments anyone can make using Paintshop Pro, Photoshop, or even the free, multiplatform image-editing program, The GIMP.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Under this scenario, Microsoft pays an engineering fee that is lucrative for both ATI and IBM, but it doesn&#8217;t have to pay high margins to ATI or IBM for making the chips, and it can go directly to a chip contract manufacturer. The goal is to cut costs and to control its destiny. After all, Microsoft remembers it lost $125 on each of the first Xbox machines sold, and it got into a dispute with Nvidia over chip pricing to boot</blockquote>

<p>Okay, it looks like <a href="http://www.jeremie.com/Dev/XML/">the parser I am using now</a> just won&#8217;t work &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t appear to retrieve XML node attributes properly, and ATOM feeds seem to use <code>href</code> attributes in their <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags  to link to stuff, as opposed to RSS/RDF which uses the contents of the tag.  So I&#8217;m switching to <a href="http://www.gazingus.org/html/XML_Parser_in_JavaScript.html">this much newer and better XML Parser for Javascript</a>, which closely follows the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html">org.w3c.dom</a> parser classes in Java.  It means I&#8217;ll have to rewrite the feed parsing, but that&#8217;s really not a huge deal.</p>

<p>this.raw = runCommand(&#8220;curl -f -s -L &#8212;connect-timeout 10 &#8212;max-time 30 &#8216;&#8221; + this.url + &#8220;&#8217;&#8221;);</p>

<p>[You&#8217;re putting single quotes around the URL]</p>

<p>I know nothing about JS / Konfabulator / etc., but there seems to be something happening such that the URLs are not being interpreted / loaded properly if not placed in single quotes.  Fixed my similar problems anyway.</p>

<p>GREAT widget, btw, much appreciated.</p>

That works fine on OS X (which was konfab&#8217;s only platform when I was using it), and if you have a Windows binary in your path it works on Windows, but not on most Windows boxes.  I have a version I&#8217;ll upload later today that uses the built-in functionality in newer versions of Konfab to retrieve the feed.</p>

<p>That will help if you&#8217;re on OS X, but Windows doesn&#8217;t ship with it, which is obviously a problem for cross-platform support.  The new version I&#8217;m about to upload doesn&#8217;t use curl anymore.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m gonna have to take your word for that - again, I know so little about JS / Konfab / et. al., but I&#8217;m running XP right now and your widget worked for me from the time I downloaded it; just not on sites which had any characters (&#8216;&amp;&#8217;, &#8216;%&#8217;, etc.) in the URLs, and that&#8217;s the only thing that changed for me with the above&#8230; in any case, as you say, with the new version it&#8217;ll be easier for everyone - thanks for bringing it back with the new versions!</p>

<p>This is really kickass.  I&#8217;m running it on my Windows desktop as we speak, and will probably be putting it on my iBook as well.  I&#8217;m even motivated to fix the compatibility issues in my old RSS Viewer widget that I wrote a couple years back.</p>

<blockquote>Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O). on Monday will announce the acquisition of Konfabulator, a Macintosh and Windows application that allows users to run mini files known as Widgets on their desktop &#8212; the same model used by Apple for its Dashboard application. Yahoo! company executives said they would also be giving Konfabulator away for free, completely doing away with the US$19.95 currently charged for the product.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.workhabit.com/?p=68">workhabit: blog &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Bryan Buchs has been building web sites for 11 years&#8230;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I was amused this mornin&rsquo; by Bryan Buchs claim that he has been building websites for about 11 years.

The World Wide Web was released by CERN in 1991. In 1992, surfing the Internet was invented. 1993 Internic comes to life, later to become a royal pain, and we see the first WWW Worm, Spiders, etc. The first Internet Talk Radio. Mosiac. 1994 WWW edged out everybody&rsquo;s favorite service, Telnet, to become the 2nd most popular service on the Net (still lagging ftp). Now, for this guy to make this claim, he would have had to have been building websites commercially in 1994.</blockquote>

<p>Great movie that touched my old nostalgic heart.

<p>I installed Wordpress on my server, and set up a site. It&#8217;s a relly nice piece of software. However, I am missing a piece of functionality, and</p>

<p>couldn&#8217;t find a suitable answer for it. Mayou you know a plugin I could use?I need to automatically inserts ads in my posts.And not AdSense ads, but rather HTML snippets defined by me (affiliate links, etc). Let&#8217;s say I would insert a tag in my post:
&#8212; ad here &#8212;
and the plugin would automatically replace it with some HTML code, when the post is displayed on my site.I really don&#8217;t need any fancy configuration options etc, just the basic replace functionality.
Do you know a plugin that can handle this?</p>

<blockquote>Another Fox News host, John Gibson, said before the blasts that the International Olympic Committee &#8220;missed a golden opportunity&#8221; by not awarding the 2012 games to France. &#8220;If they had picked France instead of London to hold the Olympics, it would have been the one time we could look forward to where we didn&#8217;t worry about terrorism. They&#8217;d blow up Paris, and who cares?&#8221; He added: &#8220;This is why I thought the Brits should let the French have the Olympics - let somebody else be worried about guys with backpack bombs for a while.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1355">#1355 (General category always assigned) - WordPress Trac - Trac</a></p>

<p>So basically, whenever you post with an external client, no matter what categories you select, your default category is ALSO assigned.  This is particularly annoying when you use your category in your nicely formatted URLs, because the default cat is often the one that gets used (I guess because it&#8217;s the first one encountered in the DB query), and pings sent out when you post will reference and URL with the default cat in it.  Removing the default cat from that post will then result in &#8220;not found&#8221; errors.</p>

<p>This problem was <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/9698">first reported in April</a>.  I&#8217;m kind of bummed that a couple releases have gone by with no one taking a couple minutes to patch the code.  For now, I&#8217;m doing it manually, but if another release comes out without it and I have to do some diff/patching shit, I&#8217;ll be very annoyed.</p>

<p>Rarr!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The patching directions in the forum thread are a little misleading, as the new 1.5.1.3 version of xmlrpc.php has changed a lot, so line numbers are quite different.  Here&#8217;s what I did to get it working.</p>

<p>Old:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
620   } else {
621     $post_category[] = $post_default_category;
622   }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>New:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
620   } elseif (!$post_category) {
621     $post_category[] = $post_default_category;
622   }
</pre></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=274359">PHP 5.1&#8217;s Killer Feature? - SitePoint PHP Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>At this stage, PHP 5.1 is not looking to be quite as spectacular. Some enhancements to Perl regular expressions, a few extra array functions&#8230; nothing to write home about. But there is one significant enhancement to PHP in 5.1: PHP Data Objects (PDO).

The PDO library lets you access any of an extensive selection of supported databases using a signle set of functions. So not only do you only need to learn one set of functions to write for multiple databases, but you can transition an application to another database without having to change all the functions throughout your code.</blockquote>

<p>(Via <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a>.)</p>

<p>Not a ton of detail about PDO, but I&#8217;m curious to check it out.  I&#8217;ve bought heavily into PEAR DB_DataObject on most of my apps from the past year, so I&#8217;ll be interested to see how PDO compares in terms of rapid app dev (the main reason I&#8217;ve used DB_DataObjects).</p>

<p>Check out Wez Furlong&#8217;s blog for <a href="http://netevil.org/node.php?nid=186">more info on PDO</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.akbkhome.com/">Alan Knowles</a> is working on <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/DBDO">DBDO</a>, what appears to basically be an implementation of DB_DataObject as a PECL extension &#8212; sensible, since he&#8217;s lead on DB_DataObject as well.  It&#8217;s currently quite alpha, but I hope that Alan is able to continue work on this and get it closer to a usable state.</p>

<p>I will probably give this a shot, but the lack of extension support in Camino has always ended up sending me back to Firefox.  With Safari, Firefox, Omniweb and Opera already in the market, Camino will probably always have trouble standing out if they continue to focus on &#8220;basic&#8221; features like bookmark management and duplicating functionality already in Firefox.  I don&#8217;t think Aqua form widgets are cutting it anymore.</p>

<p>This was an interesting article on recursive programming.  I do it infrequently enough that I have to try and remember how to properly structure recursive functions whenever I write one, and this gave me a few basic things to remember that will make it easier next time around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-recurs.html?ca=dgr-lnxw07Recursion">Mastering recursive programming</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Recursion is a tool not often used by imperative language developers, because it is thought to be slow and to waste space, but as the author demonstrates, there are several techniques that can be used to minimize or eliminate these problems. He introduces the concept of recursion and tackle recursive programming patterns, examining how they can be used to write provably correct programs. Examples are in Scheme and C.</blockquote>

<p>A review was requested.<br /><br />As I watched this film, I thought of the first couple Batman movies.  I never saw the Schumacher-directed ones, because it was utterly clear that they had more to do with Adam West than Frank Miller.  So fuck that.<br /><br />So I thought of the Burton-directed movies, and I came to the conclusion that Tim Burton sucks.  Fuck that Penguin shit.  Fuck Jack Nicholson.  Burton needs to stick to puppet films.<br /><br />This is the first Batmovie that actually <i>got it</i>.  It wasn&#8217;t the super best movie I ever saw in my life, but it was pretty fucking good.  Nolan and Goyer are gonna get a lot of money to make the next one.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104452.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/104452.html</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/wss_security.html">ONLamp.com: Securing Web Services with mod_security</a></p>

<p>On the front page of <a href="http://onlamp.com">ONLamp.com</a>, this article has the tag line &#8220;Protect your applications without recoding them.&#8221;  In principle and practice, I <strong>strongly</strong> disagree with this statement.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.modsecurity.org/">mod_security</a>.  It&#8217;s a fabulous tool.  But it should <em>never</em> be used as your only line of defense against malicious input. It&#8217;s a bad, bad, bad idea to put all your security eggs in one basket, simply because if we&#8217;ve learned anything in the past 50 years of computing, it&#8217;s that <em>everything</em> is flawed, and people can <em>and will</em> find and exploit that flaw.</p>

<p>Proper security is a multilayered, multi-approach thing.  And I think the author is doing a real disservice to those who are trying to educate the development community about secure practices with statements like:</p>

<blockquote>Solutions can take many different forms, ranging from secure coding practices to proper input validation. One approach is to perform content validation for each incoming request and compare it with predefined rules.</blockquote>

<p>No, no, no!  Solutions (plural) is just plain wrong.  The <strong>solution</strong> (singular) is to implement <em>all</em> of these approaches.  To not do so is either naive (if you&#8217;re relying on something someone else developed), arrogant (if you&#8217;re relying on something you developed), and in either case <em>very</em> dangerous.</p>

<p>One aspect that&#8217;s not been brought up much in the flurry of excitement over Apple&#8217;s transition to x86 has been the potential impact on the OS X gaming market.  This article on Macworld.com is quite interesting, demonstrating a wide-range of reactions from Mac game devs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/06/07/gamedev/index.php?lsrc=mwrss">Macworld: News: WWDC: Game developers react to Intel news</a>:</p>

<p>First, the optimistic view:</p>

<blockquote>Destineer and MacSoft president Peter Tamte calls Apple&rsquo;s decision to switch to an Intel-based architecture &ldquo;an aggressive move&rdquo; to grow the size of the Macintosh&rsquo;s market. &ldquo;The switch to Intel should also help us narrow the gap between a game&rsquo;s release on Windows and release on Mac.&rdquo;

Aspyr Media director of development Glenda Adams hopes Apple can &ldquo;explode their marketshare&rdquo; with a move to competitively-priced Intel-based hardware. &ldquo;If OS X has a 20 percent market share the revenue possibilities for native games could make things a lot different.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, will the potential for dual-booting Windows and OS X on the same box &#8212; or a relatively lightweight system call translator like WINE &#8212; eliminate any demand for OS X-native ports of popular titles?</p>

<blockquote>If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s conceivable that serious Mac gamers could create a dual-boot system that would allow them to run Windows versions of games. That could decimate the Mac game business, which is dependent on conversions of PC and console games that take months to release after their original counterparts.

[&#8230;]

&ldquo;Will people dual boot? Will they still prefer a native port, even if they can run Windows? What about a Windows emulation layer like Linux&rsquo;s WINE project &#8230; would that kill native game ports?&rdquo; Gordon asked.

&ldquo;In the end, at least we&rsquo;re going to find out whether it was Linux that made Linux gamers a hard market or Mac OS that made Mac gamers into discerning customers,&rdquo; Gordon told MacCentral.</blockquote>

<p>Linux, of course, being the closest competitor so far in the x86 desktop market, is really the only thing we can look to for some notion of how this might pan out.  I think they sold about 12 copies of Quake II for Linux.  On the other hand, given the facts that:</p>

<ol><li>Linux users aren&#8217;t terribly used to paying for software</li><li>Linux users tend to be savvy nerdo types who would are comfortable dual-booting their systems so they can play Windows games</li></ol>

<p>the Mac x86 gaming market seems unlikely to parallel Linux&#8217;s.</p>

<blockquote>
Aspyr&rsquo;s Adams believes that the switch to Intel may have &ldquo;a negligible change&rdquo; on sales of Mac games, at least to start. While she agrees that a dual-boot Mac might cause hardcore gamers to simply buy Windows and Windows games, she doesn&rsquo;t think that &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Mac users will want to jump through hoops. &ldquo;So the net effect may be a shift in products, but revenue may stay about the same overall,&rdquo; said Adams.
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to agree with this.  Typical Mac users don&#8217;t want to jump through a bunch of hoops to get stuff working (that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t use Linux).</p>

<p>Brian Greenstone from Pangea is far more pessimistic about the move from PPC to x86 for game devs than The Steve:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;This is far, far worse than the switch from 68000 to PowerPC ten years ago,&rdquo; said Greenstone. &ldquo;That was essentially just a recompile. This require a complete recode of data handling.&rdquo;

That opinion is shared by Brad Oliver, who works with Glenda Adams at Aspyr Studios, Aspyr&rsquo;s internal game development house. &ldquo;Byte-swapping bugs are a pain to track down,&rdquo; Oliver told MacCentral.</blockquote>

<p>Greenstone adds that Rosetta, the PPC emu layer for x86, will be almost entirely useless for games, as Altivec code cannot be emulated.  Games are certainly some of the apps most likely to have utilized vector optimizations.</p>

<blockquote>Pangea&rsquo;s Greenstone expects that what&rsquo;s inside a computer will ultimately become less important to even technically-savvy customers than what the computer can do. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be about internet bandwidth and how I can get more data faster,&rdquo; he said.</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#8217;s something that those lamenting this transition might do well to keep in mind.  PPC has done little to set apart the Mac platform in the past 5 years, at least in a positive way.  OS X, and Apple&#8217;s ability to integrate their software with their hardware (no matter what CPU it uses), is the key to the Mac&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<blockquote>REAL Software CEO and president Geoff Perlman explained that REALbasic itself is cross-platform by design, which helps REALbasic developers to make the transition. &lsquo;Most applications will require nothing but a simple re-compile, with no code changes at all,&rsquo; said Perlman in a statement.</blockquote>

<p>(Via <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">MacWorld</a>.)</p>

<p>This really isn&#8217;t a big surprise, seeing as RB can already compile Windows and Linux apps for x86.  I do wonder if <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/">RealSoftware</a> had any heads-up about the PPC->x86 transition, and whether this has anything to do with the delay of <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/realbasic2005/">RealBasic 2005</a> (which was supposed to be released by the end of May).  I have a new project in mind for RB, but I&#8217;ve been waiting for the imminent release of the new version before starting.</p>

<blockquote>Of course, videos like this make the prospect of encroaching governmental entrapment so worth the gamble! In a Burnaby, British Columbia video called Oh No (streaming wmv file), a Canadian car thief is grooving to The Verve&#8217;s Bittersweet Symphony when he realizes that he&#8217;s the target of a dragnet. As he laments his predicament, he whines &#8220;oh fuck&#8221; and &#8220;oh no&#8221; to the music. Only when the police disable his car by remote control does he realize that he&#8217;s driving a bait car. By the end of the video, you actually feel bad for this guy - no mean feat.</blockquote>

<p>I suppose this isn&#8217;t surprising, but not emulating Altivec code puts a bit of a damper on things. Running slow is one thing &#8212; not running at all is entirely another.  On the other hand, what <i>major</i> apps exist that are not either made by Apple or one of the big 3rd parties that will definitely transition their code (or have existing Windows versions that contain vectorized equivalents for x86 processors)?  I can&#8217;t think of any offhand, but I might be missing something.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/06/06/flash/index.php?lsrc=mwrss">Macworld: News: Macromedia unveils Flash Platform</a>:
<blockquote>San Francisco-based Macromedia Inc. on Monday unveiled the Flash Platform, a complete system that includes everything you need to deliver rich content, according to the company. Macromedia is also previewing the next generation Flash Player, which the company says will dramatically improve Flash&rsquo;s performance.</blockquote>

Blah blah blah Flash works on 98% of internet-enabled devices blah blah blah&#8230;

<blockquote>In addition to improving Flash&rsquo;s performance the new Flash player, code-named Maelstrom, will include a new video codec provided by On2 and will be embedded in Flash, according to Whatcott. A beta will be released to the public later this year.</blockquote>

<img src="http://www.funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/nec-legendaryaxe-thumb.jpg" class="alignright" />Wow, that&#8217;s a really bad name.  It reminds me of those fruity-ass retail boxes you used to see for 3dfx cards.  They&#8217;d have some kid with a flight stick in his hand with his hair getting blown back like in the old Memorex ads, with lots of purple and green lighting.  In some crazy jagged fonts it would say &#8220;TAKE YOUR PC TO THE RADICAL EXTREME!!!!!!!!!oneoneone,&#8221; and the kid&#8217;s eyes would be shooting fire or lightning or whatever.  Just looking at them made me really embarassed.  I couldn&#8217;t find a good picture of one in Google Image Search, though, so I&#8217;ll show you the picture of the Legendary Axe cover art that showed up instead. 

Now on to the only thing that&#8217;s actually interesting:

<blockquote>Macromedia also said it planned to join the Eclipse Foundation to develop a new industry-leading IDE based on Eclipse for building rich Internet applications that run on the Flash Platform.

&lsquo;We intend to ship a rich Internet authoring tool that we believe will be the way to build rich Internet media in the future. We believe building on Eclipse is the way to go.&rsquo;</blockquote>

Last time around, Macromedia put out &#8220;Flash Professional&#8221; and claimed it was an IDE for developing &#8220;rich&#8221; web apps.  Sorry, no &#8212; it still felt like it wanted me to make an episode of Strongbad.  What I wanted was something like OS X&#8217;s Interface Builder or RealBasic&#8217;s IDE.  Flash Pro was a far cry from either.

The announcement of what sounds like an entirely new IDE for app dev makes me think that Macromedia has finally realized that creating gay-ass animations and creating rich web apps require an <i>entirely</i> different development approach.  I don&#8217;t really recall Eclipse having much in terms of visual tools for interface building, but presumably Macromedia can just write that shit and let the Eclipse platform handle the code side of things.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;IDGNS: The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Intel has been trying to get Apple to use its processors. Has Intel been talking with Apple?

Chandrasekher: We always talk to Apple. Apple is a design win that we&rsquo;ve coveted for 20 years and we continue to covet them as a design win. We will never give up on Apple.

IDGNS: What would you be willing to do in order to win Apple&rsquo;s business?

Chandrasekher: Well, nothing unnatural that we wouldn&rsquo;t do for other design wins. It&rsquo;s got to make sense from a business standpoint. We would do what makes economic sense. If we can do that and still get the design win, we&rsquo;d do it.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>Also discussed is Intel&#8217;s apparent shutout in console CPU wins:</p>

<blockquote>We are not averse to getting a design win in the console space. What we are averse to is getting a design win at an unprofitable price point. If IBM wants to sell the Power PC processor below their cost, they can have that business. We had an opportunity to go bid on it. We did bid on it, but we didn&rsquo;t think it was worth getting that business if it was going to be unprofitable for us, so we backed away. I don&rsquo;t think it hurts us.</blockquote>

<p>And since component providers typically aren&#8217;t huge winners in the console market, you have to wonder if this will be a big payoff for IBM.  On the other hand:</p>

<blockquote>Out of three players, two weren&rsquo;t ever on IA [Intel architecture] and one was on IA and has moved. So, big deal. If you look at the console business overall it&rsquo;s predominantly a replacement market, not a growing market. And if you look at where the excitement is in terms of gaming, it&rsquo;s in online gaming. If you look at online gaming, where is most of the online gaming happening? It&rsquo;s happening on the PC.</blockquote>

<p>Not for long.  The last generation dipped its toes in the water of online gaming, and XBox Live demonstrated what it could be.  This gen of consoles will dive into the online pool once and for all, and the sheer numbers will overwhelm PC-based online gaming.</p>

Sometimes I wonder if people aren&#8217;t pressing PHP into areas where it doesn&#8217;t work out so hot.  It of course works very well for web apps, and seems decent when I&#8217;ve used it for shell scripting, but I wonder if it really lends itself to desktop GUI dev.  Then again, I&#8217;ve never tried it, so I could just be talking out of my ass.</p>

Wow. Good move. When we spoke with Nintendo about the price of their classic &lsquo;emulated&rsquo; games on the Revolution, they were coy and left the pricing up to our imaginations. I assumed they&rsquo;d follow the GBA model &mdash; 10-12 bucks for a classic would be fair. But George Harrison of Nintendo just sprung a surprise. Classic Nintendo titles will be free. Buy the console, take it home, plug it in and start playing your old faves. They&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to offer too much out of the gate. After all, you want people to spend money on the software. But as far as exciting services to offer with their new hardware, it&rsquo;s hard to come up with a better idea.</blockquote>

<p>I just LOVE it when I ask a very straightforward question on a mailing list, and get an &#8220;answer&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t address it at all.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote type="cite"><pre wrap="">Folks,
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>The php mysql api has a function "mysql_real_escape_string" that seems 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>to be able to thwart known SQL injection attacks -- at least the ones of 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>which I and other people I've discussed this with know.  I am curious to 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>know if pg_escape_string is as effective.  If not, what would need to be 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>modified to make it more effective?
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>(there is a possibility that I may be able to get a grad student to work 
<span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span> on this at the center, so detailed responses would be appreciated.)
</pre></blockquote>

<pre wrap="">
The best advice is to use bind parameters rather than trying to build
SQL strings consisting partly of user input.
</pre>

<p><br /><br />Yes, that&#8217;s not bad advice, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re just trying to help, but could you ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION? Or, if you don&#8217;t know, DON&#8217;T ANSWER.<br /><br />rarr.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/102198.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/102198.html</a></em></p>

No winners, no loosers. Just big boys and smaller ones. In the future there might be market consolidation (merging between companies, probably Nintendo & MS if Sony comes on top again) to challenge the big player. In this case my friends, we all loose.

<blockquote>Calvin Milo Alvarez, 30, of 2974 N. Gregg Ave., Fayetteville, was arrested Monday on a charge of distribution/possessing/viewing sexually explicit matter involving a child.<br /><br />Last Wednesday, Officer Chris Denton and Officer Scott Carlton responded to a call from residents of Appleby Apartments at 2974 N. Gregg Ave., according to the police report, and when they arrived, they found Alvarez dressed in a baby diaper and another male subject verbally arguing. The suspect’s computer reportedly was at the bottom of the stairs and he was bleeding from the mouth. Both men had been drinking, police said, and the second man told officers that he had walked in on the suspect, a roommate, and found him viewing child pornography on his computer, according to the police report.<br /><br />Officers reportedly seized the computer, believing it to contain child pornography and submitted it to evidence.<br /><br />On Thursday, Alvarez reportedly came to the police department to talk to Det. Mike Parks about the computer and its contents. During the interview, Parks reported, Alvarez admitted to possessing approximately 500 sexually explicit images of children.<br /><br />On Friday, a search warrant was obtained authorizing the search of the seized computer by the initial responding officers, the police reported stated, and an image of the suspect’s hard drive was obtained by a trained computer forensic examiner using special software and hardware that prevent alteration of the hard drive contents.<br /><br />A preliminary exam of the contents of the drive reportedly revealed approximately 9,000 images depicting children from ages 1 to 12 years old. Alvarez fled police on foot when they attempted to arrest him at his place of employment. He was later located at his mother’s home and was taken into custody, Parks said, adding that the identities of the children depicted are unknown and the investigation is continuing. Pair arrested on drug charge.</blockquote>

<p>Griffin and I took our weekly trip to best buy on Saturday to do a little window shopping.  One of the things that usually catches my eye is the single Mac Mini that they have sitting out amongst the laptops.  I can&#8217;t really say that this would be an extremely <em>useful</em> purchase, but boy, it sure is tiny and cute!<br /><br />I was even further tempted by the sign that was up:<br /></p>

<blockquote>All computers: 0% interest for 12 months</blockquote>

<p><br />Well shit, that&#8217;s less than $50 a month for a Mini.  Swank.<br /><br />So I inquire about whether than deal covers the Mac Mini.  See, Apple likes to not let dealers cut financing deals and such, because hey, that would sell too many Macs.  Homeboy helper dude isn&#8217;t sure, so he goes and checks.  Sure enough, no deal.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />From this, I make a couple conclusions:<br /></p>

<ul><li>Best Buy doesn&#8217;t consider the Mac Mini a &#8220;computer&#8221;</li><li>Apple doesn&#8217;t want me to think of the Mac Mini as a commodity computer.  Even though it is</li></ul>

<p>How the <strong>FUCK</strong> did I miss this story?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html">Adobe to acquire Macromedia</a><br /><br />Holy shit.  This worries me a lot, because Macromedia makes what I strongly believe is the best design tool for web graphics, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/">Fireworks</a>. Fireworks isn&#8217;t hugely popular, though, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Adobe kill it in favor of their <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop/ImageReady</a> combo.  IR is not bad, but isn&#8217;t at a vector-based tool like Fireworks, and that&#8217;s what makes Fireworks such a fucking great product.<br /><br />There is other crossover with Macromedia tools I like, but the main other one I use, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a>, is the best of breed in its category, and Adobe would be unlikely to trash it.  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/freehand/">Freehand</a> is actually a very underrated tool, but I usually end up using Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html">Illustrator</a>, if only because I know that stuff done in Illustrator will work fine at the printer (and also because Macromedia has basically abandoned it).<br /><br />Jesus.

<p>Obviously, this should be taken with the usual grain of salt &#8212; I don&#8217;t know enough about Ratzinger or Lerner to make a judgement.  <em>If</em> this is accurate, though, this is terribly disappointing, and would seem to only further distance the Roman Catholic Church from what I believe it <em>should</em> be doing: performing and promoting the <em>healing</em> work &#8212; physically, socially, and spiritually &#8212; that Christ taught.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/news_item.2005-04-19.4230239892">http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/news_<wbr />item.2005-04-19.4230239892</a><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>&#8220;While many of us agree with Ratzinger&#8217;s critique of moral relativism, he extends that critique in illegitimate and dangerous ways, equating secularism with moral relativism and suggesting that secularism is now repressing religion. Ratzinger also publicly critiques all those inside the Church who are tolerant enough to think that other religions may have equal validity as a path to God. This is a slippery slope toward anti-Semitism and a return to the chauvinistic and triumphalist views that led the Church, when it had the power to do so, to develop its infamous crusades and inquisitions. In 1997 Ratzinger called Buddhism an &#8220;autoerotic spirituality&#8221; that offers &#8220;transcendence without imposing concrete religious obligations.&#8221; Hindusim, he said, offers &#8220;false hope,&#8221; in that it guarantees &#8220;purification&#8221; based on a &#8220;morally cruel&#8221; concept of reincarnation resembling &#8220;a continuous circle of hell.&#8221; At the time, Cardinal Ratzinger predicted that Buddhism would replace Marxism as the Catholic church&#8217;s main enemy.<br /><br />&#8220;Ratzinger is being falsely described as a conservative, when in fact he, despite his publicly genteel manner, is a raging reactionary. Unlike many American conservatives who oppose gay sexual practices but not their legal rights, Ratzinger in 1992 argued against human rights for gays, stressing that their civil liberties could be &#8220;legitimately limited.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying this to knock the guy.  He seems intelligent and thoughtful.  But I don&#8217;t get what exactly he offers over, say, 10,000 other pretty smart dudes online, except perhaps the sheer amount of stuff on his site.  Why are people paying him to do this?</p>

<p>I think I read somewhere that since the drive started, he&#8217;s actually posted less often, which kind of makes me sad.  There&#8217;s probably quite a few people I&#8217;d pay to stay home and blog all day, Kottke was just the first guy who had the connections to get the word out and rack up a pile of prizes to intice people.</p>

<h2>I got a $40 book out of the deal and while a neat book, I doubt I would&#8217;ve bought it off the shelf at a book store :)  I can see how someone winning a year of flickr or something could really make it worthwhile to them.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been fucking around with Ableton Live as a DJing tool, and decided to record a full session I&#8217;ve been working on.  Note that this was recorded live &#8212; no touchups after the fact &#8212; which is pretty evident from a couple fuckups and occasional volume issues.  It mmight have been easier if I had my O2 controller, but I didn&#8217;t.  So there.</p>

<p />

<p><a href="http://www.cultofjester.com/mp3s/Live%20Demo%20Mix%202005-04-01.mp3">Live Demo Mix 2004-04-01 (75MB 192kbps mp3)</a></p>

<p />

<p>Track List:</p>

<ul>
<li>Icon of Coil - Floorkiller (2004)</li>
<li>Combichrist - Enjoy the Abuse</li>
<li>Cubanate - Oxyacetylene</li>
<li>C-Tec - Brutal</li>
<li>Cult of Jester - .44 Caliber (ironvsiron remix)</li>
<li>Deitiphobia - Retrofit (Dead Agent remix)</li>
<li>Nitzer Ebb - Getting Closer</li>
<li>Nitzer Ebb - Join in the Chant</li>
<li>Frontline Assembly - Mindphaser</li>
<li>Frontline Assembly - Sado-Masochist</li>
<li>ohGr - Lusid</li>
<li>Prodigy - Girls</li>
<li>Voxis - You Spin Me Right Round</li>
</ul>

<p>I also used loops from these additional songs</p>

<ul>
<li>Implant - Drugs vs Violent</li>
<li>VNV Nation - Circling Overland</li>
<li>VNV Nation - Kingdom (restoration)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Jesus, I fucked up spelling, markup, and the link in this post.  LJ Error Trifecta!<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/94067.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/94067.html</a></em></p>

<p>This is beautiful:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bitterwaitress.com/">http://www.bitterwaitress.com/</a><br /><br />A running theme on Dennis Miller:<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote><em>My son and I went to the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara to see the &#8220;Day After TOmorrow&#8221;. Who should proceed to fill up the entire row behind us but Dennis Miller and his 20 children, aged 6 or 7 to teen. They&#8217;re talking loudly and as the movie begins, they continue talking LOUDLY throughout the entire show. Also, his younger son had his feet on the back of my seat, kicking it the entire time. Considering I&#8217;m a single mom and it costs me at least 30-40 dollars everytime I take my kids to the show, maybe they should stay home and watch movies in their screening room.</em></blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote><em>i was in the gap shopping for my niece and nephews&#8230;in walks dennis miller with his hoard of children and i would assume his wife&#8230;he is arrogant, loud, and really ugly in real life&#8230;he and his out of control kids are looking through the merchandise and making a total unnecessary mess of everything&#8230;his wife had her head held so high she was looking down on everyone&#8230;i have to tell you he is a legend in santa barbara&#8230;there are probably hundreds of stories about him&#8230;how rude he is, how arrogant he is, how cheap he is&#8230;an all around jerk&#8230;you can contrast this with jeff bridges and his family (some of the nicest people you have ever met&#8230;i have a friend has taught two of his daughters and has ONLY nice things to say about jeff, his wife and children) and also with the late, beloved julia child&#8230;for every lousy store you hear about dennis miller, multiply that by 20 and that&#8217;s how many you will hear nice things about jeff bridges, his family and julia child&#8230;</em></blockquote>

<p><br /><br />This was pretty funny:<br /><br /><em></p>

<blockquote>I have to tell you that I doubt the Richard Simmons story, I&#8217;ve had him on my flights numerous amounts of time and he is always very gracious with us and he actually helps do the beverage cart because he says he gets bored on the long flights. However, I can&#8217;t say the same about Kathie Lee Gifford. She is horrible (and this was before the Frank and flight attendant fiasco) Frank always looks embarrassed by her behavior maybe that&#8217;s why de decided to &#8220;make it up&#8221; to one of us. Again, a sister in the sky supports you.</blockquote>

<p>One of my favorite things on the whole entire Webernet is the <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/">Best of Craigslist</a>.  Here&#8217;s a good example:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sdo/62703081.html">http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sdo/6<wbr />2703081.html</a><br /><br /><em>&#8220;The fact that you walk around naked in your apartment is fine, I guess. It’s great that you feel so comfortable with yourself and your body. The time I forgot to close my blinds, and you saw me in my underwear was fairly embarrassing, but I got over it. I can also deal with the fact you like to get into the shower and hack up half of your lung each morning because you smoke like a chimney. It’s highly annoying, but I have an ex-husband. I’m great at blocking out certain disgusting bodily functions performed by a male.<br /><br />&#8220;Saturday night though, this went a little too far. I was attempting to have a nice, civilized dinner with some friends of mine, when I hear “Oh my GOD, Oh my GOD!!!&#8221; being screamed from my bedroom. It is my friend, and he is looking out of my window into your apartment.&#8221;</em><br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/92212.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/92212.html</a></em></p>

<p>Well, my talk proposal for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCon</a> was not accepted.  On the positive side, <a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Schiflett</a> said that all the votes I received were positive (which I think means that no one voted <em>against</em> my talk &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t get <em>enough</em> votes), and that even <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/">George Schlossnagle</a>&#8217;s tutorial on PHP performance was shot down.  Apparently the number of rooms is smaller this year (despite being in the Convention Center and not the hotel), so there will actually be fewer sessions, and only the super best proposals got accepted.<br /><br />I&#8217;m bummed, because this would have been a nice feather in my cap, and would have made convincing work that this is a business trip a lot easier (they&#8217;ll pay for it as a business trip).  But, all is not lost, and if I can get us more involved in the PHP security community, I think I can still make the case.  We&#8217;ll see.<br /><br /> <em>Original link: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/90130.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/funkatron/90130.html</a></em></p>

<p>IBM came in and sold Purdue&#8217;s IT department on Websphere, so if this does pan out, it may mean more interest and opportunities for PHP on campups.  That would be nice.</p>

<p>More on this:</p>

<blockquote>Zend Core for IBM will be a seamless, out-of-the-box PHP development and production environment, based on PHP 5 technology. The product includes tight integration with IBM Cloudscape database server, DB2 and native support for XML and Web Services - supporting increased adoption of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). It delivers an unprecedented rapid development and deployment foundation for database driven applications and offers an upgrade path from the easy-to-use, lightweight Cloudscape database to the mission critical DB2, by providing a consistent API to developers.

Zend Core for IBM will be available in the second quarter of 2005 as a free download via the DB2 and Cloudscape product site and IBM&#8217;s developer portal, developerWorks via this easy-to-use package, PHP development or production servers can be setup within minutes. Additionally, a new PHP technology area will be introduced within IBM developerWorks to assist developers as they adopt PHP and IBM technologies for their applications. Zend Core for IBM support and updates will be made available directly from Zend Technologies. This offering will be compatible with existing products such as Zend Platform and Zend Studio. IBM is also planning to support Zend Core for IBM with the latest version of Informix Dynamic Server (IDS).</blockquote></li>

<p>Anyone else played with Picasa 2?  I&#8217;m really impressed.  It&#8217;s fast as hell (comparing my gf&#8217;s 2.5Ghz Celeron laptop w/192MB RAM to my iBook 1Ghz G4 with 768MB RAM), very easy to work with, seems to have more editing features than iPhoto&#8230; Hell, the program even LOOKS great &#8212; better than the brushed metal of iPhoto, fer sure.</p>

<p>I dunno that I will be using it much, since any photo cataloging I do is on OS X, but I certainly know what I&#8217;ll be recommending to others who run Windows exclusively.</p>

<p>Interesting piece that starts off talking about the guy who had broken into a number of T-Mobile accounts, and how he may have done it.  The author tests a number of basic code injection attacks, and finds that even after the fact, T-Mobile has left numerous holes in their system:</p>

<blockquote>To further corraborate that Nick used a web application hack, most likely <a href="http://www.infosecinstitute.com/blog/www.nextgenss.com/papers/advanced_sql_injection.pdf">SQL Injection</a> (a little research shows that the T-Mobile site uses IIS/ASP/SQL Server, which happens to be the easiest and most well documented platform for SQL Injection attacks), we can check out the website and try to put some invalid input into the T-Mobile login page. I was very surprised with the results, we can still put all sorts of crazy input into the login page! It is still vulnerable, even after one of the largest, most well known, and high profile hacks in the last couple of years!</blockquote>

<p>Perplexing and sad that a company with the resources &#8212; and recent embarassment &#8212; of T-Mobile apparently can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t address basic web app security.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usabilitynews.org/">Usability News - Feb 2005</a></p>

<p>Usability News has tons of <em>really</em> useful info for folks who care about usability &#8212; and if you are at all involved in making things that human being interact with, you need to care about it.  From the home page:</p>

<blockquote>Usability News  is a free web newsletter that is produced by the <a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/">Software Usability Research Laboratory (SURL)</a>. The SURL team specializes in software/website user interface design research, human-computer interaction research, and usability testing and research.</blockquote>

<p>Probably the most significant advantage the SURL stuff has over a lot of other usability info is that it&#8217;s actually based in proper scientific research, rather than the usual &#8220;common sense&#8221; approach.  One of the best examples of that is <em><a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/62/web_object_international.htm">Preliminary Examination of Global Expectations of Users&#8217; Mental Models for E-Commerce Web Layouts</a></em>, a really interesting study that examines where people from different parts of the world expect common e-commerce web objects to appear, like the &#8220;Shopping Cart&#8221; icon and &#8220;Home&#8221; link.  Stuff like this gives an interface designer real evidence to back up his or her layout choices.</p>

<blockquote>Ford said the idea was to represent what an average system administrator may do, as opposed to a &#8220;wizard&#8221; who could take extra steps to provide plenty of security on a Linux setup, for instance.</blockquote>

<p>Actually, this doesn&#8217;t entirely surpise me.  The key here is &#8220;average system administrator,&#8221; and believe me, what passes for a sysadmin these days is often pretty scary.  Windows&#8217; ease of use certainly is going to benefit folks like this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be very curious to see a similar comparison between OS X Server and the other two, as (to simplify matters way too much) OS X would seem bring the best of both worlds.</p>

<p><a href="http://shiflett.org/archive/98">Chris Shiflett: More on Filtering Input and Escaping Output</a></p>

<p>I found this post quite educational, especially about what items in the various superglobals ($_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION) are tainted.  Basically, the gist is that $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE are always provided from the user, and therefore have to be considered tainted.  $_SESSION is stored by the server, and <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> be tainted if you did your job right (i.e., you didn&#8217;t store any tainted data in the session).  $_SERVER, though, is more complex, because some of the values in that array come from the web browser, despite the name of the array.  Check the comments for more detail.</p>

<p>Well, I upgraded to WP1.5.  Looks good in general, although there&#8217;s some funkiness with moving your old layout to the new system, so I&#8217;m sticking with the default theme for now.  It makes me feel like I should own a Mac mini.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I might start posting here again.  Like, more than just what I&#8217;m posting now.</p>

<p>Good stuff here. Articles like this often lack practical implementation info, but this gives you some specifics to follow. One app it mentions that I wasn&#8217;t aware of is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/recommended/urlscan/default.asp">URLScan</a>, a free tool from MS to filter server requests.  Not that I&#8217;d ever use a MS Server for anything that the public could access, but if you <i>must</i>, this seems like a requirement for your IIS box.</p>

<p>At work we use <a href="http://www.mnogosearch.ru/">mnoGoSearch</a> to handle our sitewide search engine needs.  It&#8217;s a pretty powerful and flexible tool, but has a couple annoyances:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The documentation is uneven at best.</li>
 <li>Out of the box, the app can&#8217;t generate valid XHTML.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second one is what was annoying me today, because even after you clean up the example templates, it <em>still</em> insists on mucking up your code.  mnoGoSearch seems to rewrite some of the &lt;input&gt; tags is displays, making the &#8220;value&#8221; attribute uppercase, and forcing a space after every attribute/value combo inside the tag.  The latter is problematic because it treats the closing &#8220;/&#8221; in the &lt;input&gt; tag as an attribute, forcing a space after it.  Both of these behaviors ruin my finely tuned XHTML 1.1 transitional-valid code.</p>

<p>So, in a fit of open-source excitement, I decided to patch the code myself.  I&#8217;m definitely NOT a C programmer, but finding and patching the appropriate code was pretty straightforward.  The culprit is the TemplateTag function in the file template.c, which I&#8217;ve modified to do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Write the &#8220;value&#8221; attribute as lowercase</li>
 <li>place the separating space <em>before</em> the attribute</li>
</ol>

<p>These changes get it to play nice with XHTML, and shouldn&#8217;t affect the search engine&#8217;s ability to generate valid HTML.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m not versed in the ways of diff and patch, I&#8217;ll just upload the whole file.  It gets interesting around line 335.</p>

<p><a href="/downloads/mnogosearch/template.c">Patched template.c</a> | <a href="/downloads/mnogosearch/template.c.html">Pretty coloriffic source</a> <em>generated by <a href="http://www.bedaux.net/cpp2html/">c++2html</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> That first version didn&#8217;t really work.  This one does, though.</p>

<ul>
                    <li>April 9 Bakersfield - The Fox Theater</li>
                    <li>April 10 Agoura Hills - Canyon Club</li>
                    <li>April 15-17 Boston - Comedy Connection</li>
                    <li>April 18 Chicopee - Comedy Connection</li>
                    <li>April 22-25 New York Carolines</li>
                    <li>May 7-8 Indianapolis Funny Bone</li>
                    <li>May 11-12 St. Louis - Funny Bone</li>
                    <li>May 14-15 S. Bend - Funny Bone</li>
                    <li>June 5 Farmingdale - Dave Glickers</li>
                    <li>June 10-13 Miami - Miami Improv</li>
                    <li>June 14-16 Orlando - Orlando Improv</li>
                    <li>June 17-20 Tampa - Tampa Improv</li>
                  </ul>

<p>Okay, so like 4 of the shows are in the midwest, but the Indy show is nearby, and I am betting &#8220;S. Bend&#8221; refers to South Bend, IN, which would mean I could take a trip back to the old stomping grounds and tear shit up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2004/03/18/marc_espie.html">ONLamp.com: An Interview with OpenBSD&#8217;s Marc Espie [Mar. 18, 2004]</a></p>

<p>First off, I&#8217;m quote certain that this guy could destroy me with his mind.  I&#8217;m a lowly script/design monkey, and he&#8217;s on a whole &#8216;nother level when it comes to programming. However, I&#8217;m sorta taken aback by catty comments like this:</p>

<div class="pullquote">&#8220;The chief opponent to strlcpy in glibc is most certainly Ulrich Drepper, who argues that good programmers don&#8217;t need strlcpy, since they don&#8217;t make mistakes while copying strings. This is a very mystifying point of view, since bugtraq daily proves that a lot of Linux and free software programmers are not that bright, and need all the help they can get.<p />

(Considering the shining, flaming personality of Drepper, and the fact that he is always Right, this is not that surprising, though).&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Dude.  What the hell?  It&#8217;s one thing to call a guy an asshole when you&#8217;re sitting around the table with your fellow nerds, stuffing your face with gyro meat and complaining about how the inferior Linux gets all the glory and midget-Eminem ads, but it&#8217;s quite another to do it in a public interview.  For fuck&#8217;s sake, show some tact, man.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>While back-tracking that comment, I came across your comments, and other details; in Marc&#8217;s defense, it&#8217;s possible that he&#8217;s just fed up of patching and patching and patching the same **dd*** s*** over and over again; thus his comment.</p>

<p>&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;
As repeatedly said, these functions are completely nonsense.  They
don&#8217;t increase security, they only allow sloppy programmers get by
without fixing there code.  At any time the programmer must be aware
of the sizes of the arrays involved.  Adding these interfaces would
only mean promoting writing broken code which will never happen.
&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;
I was rather dismayed to read this, to say the least&#8212;but I must assume that he was generalising and not giving full details.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$3376">PHP Everywhere: Re: Beyond MVC</a></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t really just a .NET issue, though &#8212; this is an issue even with js-based image window popups.  It&#8217;s quite annoying when you want to share a link with someone, and have to include detailed instructions instead of just an url.</p>

<p>It always seemed like  a bad idea to do some kind of server or client detection by checking for a short string anywhere in the fingerprint.  <a href="http://circle.ch/blog/p1375.html">This is a good example of why</a>.</p>

<p>Just in case anyone is planning on getting snooty about it, I&#8217;m aware that some of the code in my old posts doesn&#8217;t validate as XHTML.  I was kinda lazy with the code in MT, so those posts that I imported have some problems.  I&#8217;ll have to clean them up here sometime soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zeit.ca/mozie/">Mozie</a> looks like a really useful tool to do side-by-side comparisons of IE and Gecko page renderings.  Windows only, unfortunately, but that&#8217;s to be expected.  It&#8217;s apparently built off of the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/control.htm">Mozilla ActiveX control</a>, which allows windows devs to embed Mozilla in their apps.  I wonder if it would be possible to just serve your page in Mozilla, embedded within IE.  I&#8217;m sure someone will try this shortly.</p>

<p>Can you tell what my new favorite project is?</p>

<div class="pullquote"><a href="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/rss-viewer-0.3.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/rss-viewer-0.3.png','popup','width=985,height=737,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/rss-viewer-0.3-tm.jpg" height="112" width="149" align="right" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="screenshot" title="" longdesc="" /></a>New this version:
<ul><li>Combined feeds and items sidebar frames into a single menu system</li><li>Added fancy gradients to make it look more 1337</li></ul></div>

<p>I&#8217;m rather proud of the new menu system.  It dynamically loads the feeds when requested, as opposed to having to build the whole menu tree when the feeds frame loads.  Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

<ol><li>User clicks on feed title, triggering javascript that loads an url w/ parameters into a hidden frame</li><li>php script takes url parameters, downloads feed, and generates the html along with a javascript command to insert the html into the feeds menu</li><li>when page is loaded into hidden frame, the generated javascript is executed, and the items html is inserted and shown</li></ol>

<p>It&#8217;s convoluted, but it seems to work!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>  Links would be good.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.funkatron.com/rss_viewer/">Demo</a></li><li><a href="http://www.funkatron.com/apps/funkatron_rss_viewer/rss_viewer-0.3.tgz">Download</a></li></ul>

<p>This is just a quick implementation of an idea I had, one mostly inspired by the RSS Reader Panel extension for Firebird.  I&#8217;ve only tested it in Firebird and Safari so far.</p>

<p>You should be able to just dump this in your web docs tree and fire it up in your browser.  Edit the feedurls.conf file to change the feeds.</p>

Everyone is shitting their pants about Madonna and Britney (<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pr0t/28955.html">except pr0t</a>), but I&#8217;m personally pissed that they cut away to show Justin Timberlake&#8217;s reaction instead of the Madonna/Christina Aguilera kiss, which I imagine would have been much hotter, and probably involve some kind of Japanese fetish porn.

What was the sound you heard at the end of Christina Aguilera&#8217;s performance?  That was the sound of thousands of late 80&#8217;s and early 90s hipsters throwing out their Jane&#8217;s Addiction records.  Dave, are you really that desperate for cash?  Good Lord man, show some backbone.

<p>Things I discovered tonight:</p>

<ul>
<li>A: .Mac account passwords can be 6-32 characters</li>
<li>B: The .Mac iDisk Utility for XP (which Apple wrote) can only use passwords of 6-8 characters</li>
<li>A+B = God forbid I use a .Mac password over 8 characters and want to upload to my iDisk from XP</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, Appleworks sucks.</p>

<p>RSS Viewer now supports multiple feeds, and is available for download.  From the readme:</p>

<div class="pullquote">
<a href="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/screenshot_konfab1.0beta4.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/screenshot_konfab1.0beta4.jpg','popup','width=1152,height=768,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/screenshot_konfab1.0beta4-tm.jpg" height="106" width="160" align="right" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="RSS Viewer - screenshot with 1.0 Beta 4 running" title="" longdesc="" /></a>
You can enter multiple urls in the &#8220;RSS Feed URL:&#8221; preference, separated
by &#8220;|&#8221; (pipe) characters.  For example:<p></p>

 <span style="padding-left:10px;font-family:monospace"><b>http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rdf|http://www.hardocp.com/hardocp.rdf|http://www.funkatron.com/mt/index.rdf</b></span><p></p>

Items from the feeds are displayed in the same window by their order in
their respective feed: item 1 of feed 1 is shown first, then item 1 of
feed 2, then item 2 of feed 1, etc.
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I got your excellent widget, RSS Viewer, and custumized it to a swedish widget that reads the news from the site Vänster.nu.
May I submit this custumized widget to Konfabulator.com as “Vänster.nu widget”?</p>

<p>Of course i´m give you some cred and write &#8220;this widget was based on RSS Viewer by Ed Finkler, which was initally based on the Fark.com feed viewer by Toe.</p>

<p>I believe I fixed the crashing problems &#8212; it appears that Konfab&#8217;s 
url.fetch() method has problems with longish documents.  Switching to 
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> fixed the issue.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I was looking for a basic RSS Viewer widget for <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com">Konfabulator</a>.  Strangely, I couldn&#8217;t find one in their gallery; it was all stuff designed to view one or a handful of feeds.  So I wrote my own.  It has problems with a couple feeds I&#8217;ve run across (most notably the one for <a href="http://www.phaedo.cx">phaedo.cx</a>), but for the most part it seems to function as it should.</p>

<p><br clear="all" /></p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>If people dig it, I&#8217;ll try and add a couple more features.  The big one I&#8217;d like to do is the ability have a personalized set of feeds to choose from, rather than having to enter a new url each time you want to view a different feed.

<p>Nah, I&#8217;m not dead &#8212; just busy.  We finally moved, and we&#8217;re still kinda trying to get settled.  We also had to buy <a href="http://finklers.com/ed/pics/jetta/">a new car</a>, which wasn&#8217;t bad since the car is BAD-AZZ, but not great since it meant we had a car payment again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As for development, LameBrain has lately taken a backseat to work on Funkatron Viewer, a simple image viewer intended to sorta emulate the feel of <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</a>, my favorite Win32 image viewer.  FV should be ready for release sometime in the next couple weeeks.  I do still intend to work on LB, and I have some exciting ideas for it, but I just don&#8217;t have the time right now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This site may be changing in the next few weeks.  I want to get more consulting business going, so it&#8217;s likely that Funkatron.com will be the address for that.  This blog and the apps will still be available, although you might have to click once or twice to find them.</p>

<p>This release re-enables the ability to use LAME to write ID3 tags when using the CD Ripper.  I got requests to put this back in because LAME will use ID3V2 tags if the data exceeds ID3v1&#8217;s 30-character limit.  LameBrain will use LAME by default when ripping a CD, but you can disable it in the preferences if you like.</p>

Yes, I&#8217;m still working on LameBrain; slower than before, but still going.  I took a lil&#8217; screen shot of the newest version, which features super-fancy row background graphics.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I also uploaded the Powerpoint file I used in a very short presentation I did for the <a href="http://mac.purdue.org">Purdue University Mac Users Group</a> on LameBrain. It&#8217;s really not too terribly interesting, but maybe someone will dig it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in this version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you previous installed a preview version of 0.6.0, you should delete your preferences file BEFORE running 0.6.0 final.  It should be &lt;your home directory&gt;:Library:Preferences:LameBrain 0.6 Prefs</li>
  <li>All main encoding windows (single file/batch/cd ripper) have been combined into a single window.  Stats have been moved to the LAME settings window under the Stats tab.  Size of LAME settings window has been reduced. Appropriate changes have been made to the Preferences window</li>
  <li>ID3v1.1 tag viewing and editing is enabled using <a href="http://www.dakotacom.net/~donut/programs/id3ed.html">id3ed</a>.  Only v1.1 tags are currently supported</li>
  <li>FreeDB server preference can now be selected from a dropdown menu.  You can add or remove servers by editing the data/freedb_mirrors.txt file</li>
  <li>LAME executable has been moved to bin/ subdirectory</li>
  <li>Profiles have been moved into &#8220;Profiles&#8221; subdirectory.  You will need to move your custom profiles into this folder for them to be usable</li>
  <li>Extended ASCII chars are now converted to &#8220;_&#8221; in output filenames</li>
  <li>Added debug logging functionality.  Debug info is logged to file in &#8220;logs/&#8221; subdir, and can be turned on or off in Preferences.  Logging can slow LB down and the file can get quite large, so this should only be used if you&#8217;re having problems</li>
  <li>Added ability to view TOC.plist file of currently selected CD. Useful for debugging purposes</li>
  <li>New, fancier About window. Woo!</li>
  <li>Eject button removed since preview versions; will reappear soon</li>
  <li>Experimental: LameBrain will try to copy the ID3 tags from an input mp3 file to the re-encoded version</li>
  <li>Fancy new icons for the control bar by <a href="http://www.transmtt-r.com/">Ken Holewczynski</a></li>
  <li>Clip player will now show artist and title if ID3 info is present</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where LameBrain would crash if it found a mounted DVD</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs with double-quotes in ID3 tags when CD ripping</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where Year info was not retrieved from FreeDB</li>
  <li>fixed issue where colons in CD info tags were causing Nil Object Exceptions when the .m3u file was written</li>
 </ul>

<p>I did some tests last night using &#8212;alt-preset standard on 3.90.2, 3.93.1, and a new compile of 3.93.1 I did with several compiler optimization settings:</p>

<pre>
-faltivec -mcpu=7450 -mdynamic-no-pic -funroll-loops -ffast-math -fstrict-aliasing -O3
</pre>

<p>Here are the results of the tests I did. I wouldn&#8217;t call them scientific, but I did use the same file for each, and didn&#8217;t do anything else while it was encoding.</p>

<p>Note that I did NOT do any listening tests &#8212; this is just comparing speed. It looks to me that the plain 3.93.1 is faster than 3.90.2, and the optimized 3.93.1 is significantly faster than 3.93.1 standard. The optimizations I did might keep the binary from working on G3s and older G4s (&lt; 500Mhz, I think), so I want to run some tests on it before including it as standard in LameBrain.  If you are willing to give it a shot, please <a href="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/files/lame_binary-g4optimized.gz">download the binary and let me know the results.</p>

<p>I do.  They put out four albums in the 80s that varied from <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Kill_em_all.shtml">very good but corny</a> to <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/And_justice_for_all.shtml">fucking amazing</a>.  Then the 90s rolled around, and they did one <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Metallica.shtml">kinda okay album</a>, and two <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Load.shtml">which made</a> <a href="http://www.encycmet.com/discography/Re_load.shtml">me cry</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my opinion, the 90s downslide wasn&#8217;t so much the instrumentation, which varied from kinda okay to occasionally quite good, but the lyrics and vocals.  Let&#8217;s compare the former:</p>

<ul><li>
&#8220;Blackened&#8221;, 1988<br />
<i> Blackened Is the End<br />
Winter it Will Send<br /></i>
<p></p></il>

<li>
&#8220;I Disappear&#8221;, 2000<br />
<i>Hey Hey Hey<br />
Here I go now<br /></i>
<p></p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>What the hell?</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>As for the vocals, Hetfield has certainly increased his singing ability and vocal range, but he also started saying &#8220;oooh&#8221; and &#8220;yeah!&#8221; a lot.  Rob Zombie pulls off &#8220;yeah,&#8221; but James just doesn&#8217;t.  It sounds wimpy, especially when he sings old songs (their perfomance of &#8220;Fade to Black&#8221; at the VH1 Music Awards a couple years ago actually made the <i>original</i> version unlistenable for a few months)</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway, the three remaining members of Metallica have a new album coming out soon called <i>St. Anger</i>.  The word on the street is that it&#8217;s supposed to be a return to the pre-suck era.  I first read this on the MTVNews site, and was fairly suspicious, since the guy who wrote the article probably thought the last Limp Bizkit album had &#8220;killer riffs.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.encycmet.biz/news/2003-04-02.shtml">But this review</a> translated from <a href="http://www.closeupmagazine.net/metallica.php">a Swedish mag called Close-Up</a> was also very positive about the album, and I&#8217;m about a trillion times more likely to trust a Swede &#8212; any Swede &#8212; about metal than I am a guy whose career ambition is to follow in the footsteps of Gideon Yago.  I do find it odd that they did this after the only guy in the band who seemed to remember what was cool about Metallilca left, but hey, maybe they&#8217;re doing coke again.</p>

<p></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In fact I wrongly assumed it was a network issue - it just did the same thing after ripping a track to a local folder, although the file seems to be complete. The actual error is:</p>

<p>An exception of class NilObjectException was not handled.
 The application must shut down.</p>

<p>However, since it is not a known problem I&#8217;ve done some more checking and found that Single File Ripping works either to local or network volume. So does this mean it&#8217;s a problem with dealing with the CD, or is it due to the fact that this method doesn&#8217;t entail writing ID3 tag info into the file?</p>

<p>A couple of other quick questions:</p>

<p>Should it save the LAME settings on exit? I have to choose &#8216;standard&#8217; every time I start the app.</p>

<p>Do the presets override everything - ALL other settings?</p>

<p>Can it write ID3 V2 tags?</p>

<p>Can it create Artist/Album folders when ripping an entire CD?</p>

<p>These are relatively minor compared to the main issue of crashing after ripping a CD track, but help on all the above would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey, remember yesterday when I was talking about how when you do SHIFT+CTRL+Enter in Moz on Windows, it sends the message?  It doesn&#8217;t.  It secretly hides the message, just like on the Mac.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been using Mozilla mail again, since it&#8217;s a little more powerful than Mail.app.  Plus, this way I&#8217;m using the same client on Mac and PC (no way in hell I&#8217;m using Outlook Express, especially after my friend&#8217;s PC got a virus just from <b>reading a message</b> in OE).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now on the PC version of Moz Mail, SHIFT+ALT+Enter sends the message you&#8217;re composing.  I&#8217;ve gotten quite in the habit of using this, since I&#8217;m all about the keyboard shortcuts, dontcha know?  So naturally, when I start using Moz mail on OS X, I attempt to do something similar with SHIFT+CMD+Return.  Everything looks fine, although I do find it odd that if I hit CMD+Return, it appears to also send, except it asks me first if I <i>really</i> wanna send a message.  I don&#8217;t like ther computer second-guessing me, so I avoid using that shortcut and stick to my tried-and-true triple keypress.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Lately, a few people who I sent email to said they haven&#8217;t been getting it.  I poke around in my Sent folder, and sure enough, the messages aren&#8217;t there.  I check my preferences to make sure sent mail is getting copied to the Sent folder, and everything looks okay.  I decide to send myself some email; it never arrives.  What the hell?</p>

<p></p>

<p>So I get all scientific and send two messages.  One I send with the SHIFT+CMD+Return command, the other with the CMD+Return command.  Guess which one shows up?</p>

<p></p>

<p>So now I realize that probably the last 30 emails I &#8220;sent&#8221; didn&#8217;t actually go anywhere.  But they&#8217;re not saved in my drafts folder or anything like that.  As far as I can tell, SHIFT+CMD+Return is a shortcut for a hidden &#8220;fuck this noise&#8221; command that immediately destroys your message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then I notice this option under the File menu called &#8220;Send Later.&#8221;  Now there isn&#8217;t a key shortcut listed next to this command, so one would think that there wasn&#8217;t a shortcut for it.  One apparently would be wrong for thinking this, because once I hit &#8220;Send Unsent Messages,&#8221; Mozilla starts sending about 3000 messages, all the while saying over and over &#8220;damn, you <i>are</i> a dumbass, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;  Because God forbid Mozilla <i>ask me</i> if I really want to instantly hide my message deep inside its poop chute where I&#8217;ll never find it, instead of sending it immediately.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So if you just got 10 messages from me, now you know why.</p>

<p></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You know, while you&#8217;re on the mac, you might want to get down with the menu system.  I&#8217;d been reading up on it and the whole &#8220;menu vs. keyboard shortcut&#8221; issue is really interesting.  Those top-of-screen mac menus gain about a zillion usability points over windows menus cause of the increased screen real estate, and they did a ton of tests back in the day that showed that&#8230;</p>

<p>1) using menus feels slower than using keyboard shortcuts</p>

<p>2) using menus is virtually always actually faster than using keyboard shorcuts</p>

<p>They eventually figured out that it takes more brainpower to remember a key combo than to look through a menu, and therefore you concentrate harder when using your keyboard shortcut, and you actually are amnesic for the time it took to remember the shortcut.  You think it was instantaneous, but it wasn&#8217;t,a nd the time it took was longer than the time it would have taken you to hit the menu item.</p>

<p>Those little half-seconds of concentration can hose you.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying going with the menus rather than key combos lately and it&#8217;s been working well for me &#8212; feels slightly slower but my work flow is still smooth.</p>

<p>And you never get hosed by the old &#8220;what are the keyboard shortcuts for THIS app?&#8221; phenomenon.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are that it&#8217;s definitely the case that menu systems are faster if we&#8217;re talking about exclusively using either menus or keystrokes.  My personal experience, though, is that it is definitely worth the time investment to learn keyboard shortcuts for things you do a lot.  A couple examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switching to the object or point selection tool in Illustrator</li>
<li>Inserting a &#8220;&#8221; tag in BBEdit</li>
</ul>

<p>I end up doing those things SO frequently that I&#8217;ve found that it really pays off.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Keyboard shortcuts are defininetly faster, the only time you notice a concentration break is when you switch software. Im sure that the part of your brain which manages shortcut keys is not the same as the one your using to code or whatever. The drawback is finding myself wanting to hit undo when Im sketching on paper.</p>

<p>Imagine going to a menu every time you wanted to cut and paste or change tools in Photoshop.</p>

<p>By the way if you have a problem with Mozilla why don&#8217;t you post a bug report / enhancement request, I have found the Mozilla team to be incredibly responsive.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I believe those are the settings you get if you use the special &#8212;r3mix preset in LAME.  There is a GUI setting to enable that preset, and one of the default profiles that comes with LameBrain uses thast setting.  You could also put those command line options into the &#8220;Expert&#8221; setting and save them to a profile if you like.</p>

<p>And yes, you would get the same quality as on a PC.  LAME is identical from platform to platform, except for speed optimizations for specific processors.</p>

<p>Work and home life have been pretty hectic lately, so I haven&#8217;t had a ton of time to work on LameBrain.  I&#8217;ll try to get 0.5.2 up this weekend, which will include some bug fixes on the app side, as well as the first <b>complete</b> version of the docs.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.funkatron.com/mt/images/biteme.gif" height=105 width=150 align="Right" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="">
I have a <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com">new web host</a>.  Why?  Because Hostrocket left an exploit on their servers which was exploited to <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=124584">deface many of their customers&#8217; sites</a>, including my site and 2 of my clients&#8217; sites.  When I inquired about a refund for this massive screwup (a free month&#8217;s hosting seemed not unreasonable), they told me they won&#8217;t be giving refunds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had problems with HR, but it&#8217;s gonna be the last.  If they can&#8217;t throw their customers a bone after totally dropping the ball security-wise (<a href="http://security-archive.merton.ox.ac.uk/archive-200111/0352.html">again</a>), they clearly don&#8217;t deserve my business.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t think they deserve your business.  So screw &#8216;em.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PS: One more cool thing about the switch: MT actually functions correctly.  No more 500 errors.  Hooray!</p>

<p>Today I walked outside.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t noteworthy for that fact alone, but because I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. I very, very rarely leave my apartment without the intention of going somewhere; usually work, but occasionally to run an errand.  The time spent outside is very rarely any more than necessary to walk the 15 paces to my car.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the car, the radio is always on.  Sometime music; more often sports talk radio.  At home, the TV is always on.  Griffin is always playing with a toy or being fussy or needing attention.  I always have the laptop nearby, and I spend probably 70% of my time looking at the same websites over and over.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since I was a little kid, my ears have rung.  I have a constant high-pitched ringing 24/7/365, and I have since I was 8 or 9.  I very rarely notice it anymore, because it&#8217;s with me all the time.  The constant din of media and activity is like that ringing. It&#8217;s a perpetual white noise that follows me everywhere.  It&#8217;s there all the time, so I just tune it out.  It&#8217;s &#8220;normal,&#8221; so I don&#8217;t perceive it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The problem is, even though I don&#8217;t notice it, it still affects me.  I know this because when I stepped outside, set my white plastic lawn chair on the grass and sat down, I felt much more at ease than I had in a long time.  My anxiety about pratically everything dissipated.  I felt the world moving around me, and I knew that it would be&#8230; <i>okay</i>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve acquired many things.  I own tons of DVDs and games and computer junk.  But none of them ever make me feel as right with the world as sitting outside did today.</p>

<p>Honestly though, since I got hip to thinking like this I can&#8217;t stand the sound of the TV.  I try to spend about a 3rd of my time driving without the radio.  What&#8217;s happened now, is my hearing has become more sensitive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always just searching for a silence.  What I&#8217;ve started to notice is that my computer (even my powerbook) make all sorts of noise.  It drives me up the wall!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also started to replace certain lightbulbs that make noises.  There&#8217;s electronics all over my house that make little hums and hisses.  Am I going crazy or what?!?</p>

<p>But sitting outside, or going to for a hike, that&#8217;s the only true relief.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>i know this moise. Its like when you know the computer or tv is on as they give off this 20k sound that you just tune out to but this noise is much higher and i ve never known a time when i  didnt hear it. Since i was a young child its been there. Ive read in books that its a frequency net around the planet and that they increase it each night to block out psychic activity. Thats why its best to sleep in the day because its lower. Have you found that you sleep better when you get an afternoon nap rather than a night time sleep.
 I can sleep on my back during the day but not at night.Its a shame really as your body can heal betterv when your spine is straight as your body can get better circulation so you produce more growth hormone. 
I notice all the frequencies of computers, tv, radio, even irons, they all give off emf and its making me search for a solution, not just something to drown it out but something to silence it.</p>

<p>So in the past couple days we&#8217;ve gotten two new browser releases for OS X: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino (ex-Chimera) 0.7</a>, and Safari 1.0 b64.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Camino 0.7 doesn&#8217;t make any groundbreaking improvements, but it does seem to be a little faster.  It has a kinda swank download manager, but I&#8217;ve almost always found those things a waste of time.  It apparently can do auto-discovery of local web and ftp servers via Rendezvous, but I haven&#8217;t actually seen it work yet (I&#8217;m probably missing something though).  And I still can&#8217;t seem to do type ahead find with it, which I take advantage of with Phoenix on Win32.  Still, Camino remains my main browser.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Safari 1.0 b64 isn&#8217;t a public release, so no linking to it will be done here (I&#8217;m purely a leech), but if you look around on <a href="http://arstechnica.infopop.net/OpenTopic/page?a=frm&s=50009562&f=8300945231">message boards</a> you&#8217;ll find it without too much trouble.  The major new thing is tabbed browsing, which first appeared in b62 (also not a public release), and has been refined a bit here.  Tabs were really the main reason I wasn&#8217;t using Safari, and their appearance here makes it much more competitive with Camino.  Plus, I have to admit that I&#8217;m something of a brushed metal whore.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Personally, I would like to see Camino focus more on new and cool features, kind of the way Opera brings a lot of unique features to the platforms it supports.  It seems unlikely that Camino will overcome Safari in terms of market share, and the features that initially brought it popularity &#8212; looking and feeling like a true Aqua app, having a very solid rendering engine, etc &#8212; are being duplicated or improved upon in Safari.  But if it offers some features that appeal to power/niche users &#8212; ones that Apple is less likely to explore because they don&#8217;t appeal to Joe Switcher &#8212; it&#8217;s likely to shore up a dedicated user base.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s taken a while to get out, but LameBrain 0.5.1 is finally available.  Goodies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>New feature: &#8220;Expert&#8221; tab allowing manual entry of command-line parameters</li>
<li>New feature: Customizable naming schemes for ripped files</li>
<li>New feature: Preference to delete source files after encoding finishes</li>
<li>Fix: Encoding Settings window control states are saved when window is closed</li>
<li>More progress on docs (still not finished)</li>
<li>Some other stuff I forgot</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve decided to start asking for donations for LameBrain.  LB is still <b>free</b>, but a little bit of coin will help defray development costs (stuff like Coke and <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com">Jimmy John&#8217;s</a>).  If you&#8217;d like to donate, just click the button on the maIn page of my blog.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just posted my comments on the MacUpdate site, where I gave LB 5 stars in every category possible. You&#8217;ve got a great app started here, and I hope it continues. I downloaded it on a whim about two weeks ago, but I&#8217;ve since begun using it for all my CD ripping.</p>

<p>One concern: LB used to come with a handy help file, I think, which defined the encoding options and LAME terms (e.g., What is LAME? What does joint mean? What is VBR?), and I found it useful. Will that be included in future releases?</p>

<p>Thought I would mention one quick bug, that should be easy to fix:</p>

<p>While LAMEBrain properly prefaces encoded filenames with a 0 in front of the track number(to make them sort correctly in the finder), it forgets to add the 0 in front of the .m3u file listing, making all the playlists incorrect. Easy to fix on my end, as well, but I thought you would want to know.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.funkatron.com/blog/images/tommy.gif" height=163 width=143 align="right" border=1 alt="ROCK AND ROLL!!!!">
I buy CDs a lot less now, but every once in a while I binge a little.   On our way back from lunch today, we stopped in this college student convenience store; one of those places that has everything a young learner needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cigarettes</lI>
<li>Cheap soda</li>
<li>Incense</li>
<li>3000 different types of Purdue shirts (to remind you where you are)</li>
<li>Maxim magazine</li>
<li>Really cheap used CDs</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s the last item that I was particularly interested in.  The average price of a used CD there is about $5.50, whereas most places would charge $10.  It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re all winners (there were about 30 copies of <a href="http://www.coolio.com/" title="this is the shittiest web site in the world">Coolio&#8217;s</a>  <i>It Takes a Thief</i>), but there are usually a few gems to be found.  Here&#8217;s what I picked up during this expedition:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.remhq.com/">R.E.M.</a> - <i>Green</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=B8bknu3l5an1k">GTR</a> - <i>GTR</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.epitonic.com/artists/nullset.html">Nullset</a> - <i>Nullset</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creation-records.com/ride/carnival.html">Ride</a> - <i>Carnival of Light</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.izzy-stradlin.com/jujuhounds.htm">Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds</a> - <i>Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.officialtomwaits.com/">Tom Waits</a> - <i>Rain Dogs</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.soundgarden.fan.pl/">Soundgarden</a> - <i>Superunknown</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lit-up.com/">Buckcherry</a> - <i>Buckcherry</i></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mygnr.com/">Guns n&#8217; Roses</a> - <i>Live Era &#8216;87-&#8216;93</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these were nostalgia pickups (GTR, for example), and some were taking a chance because I liked a song I heard (Buckcherry, Ride).</p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 24px; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 4px;" title="TITLE"></p>

<p>Now, the ripping begins&#8230;</p>

The last remnants of Atari Games, the coin-op developer that spun of from the console-making atari in 1984 (I think), died with the closing of Midway Games West this month.  This inspired Gamespy to do a <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/top10/february03/atari/">roundup on what they consider the 10 best Atari games to ever grace arcades</a>.  Since I&#8217;m all about never getting over my past, I loved this article.  You should too.</p>

<p>LB, the <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/~w-12947/Sound/boomstic.wav">BOOMSTICK</a> of LAME front-ends, is now ready and waiting.</p>

<ul>
<li>GUI change: Encoding Settings now have their own window, as does the Single File Encoder.</li>
<li>GUI change: New Control Bar window.</li>
<li>GUI change: Minor changes to menubar.</li>
<li>GUI change: New keyboard shortcuts for all windows (CMD+0&#8230;5).  Using a keyboard shortcut now brings a currently open-window to the front.</li>
<li>Change: Single File Encoder and CD Ripper both get their encoding settings from the Encoding Settings window.  This offers significantly more flexibility.</li>
<li>Help: Popup Help now available on all controls.</li>
<li>Docs: Documentation started (nowhere near finished).  See the &#8220;docs&#8221; directory.</li>
<li>Preferences: User can now choose which windows are opened on startup.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Timeout on new version check on startup reduced to 7 seconds; limits startup delay if cannot connect to server.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Preferences are now only saved when &#8220;Save&#8221; is clicked.</li>
<li>Probably more minor stuff I can&#8217;t remember.</li>

<p>I&#8217;ve often been frustrated with the fact that OS X&#8217;s Terminal doesn&#8217;t by default support proper text coloring.  The main issue has been with supporting syntax coloring in <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a>, which I use to edit files at work when I&#8217;m at home and outside work&#8217;s firewall/behind my NAT router.  I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where not having syntax coloring sends me into fits of rage, so for the sake of my family, it was important that I find a solution.</p>

<p>(It <i>is</i> true that you can <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020408225741777">change your term emu to vt100-color</a>, but then you have to do this on all the machines you ssh to as well, which isn&#8217;t really a good idea when you&#8217;re using a shared account like I am.)</p>

<p>Anyway, somebody mentioned a Terminal replacement for OS X called <a href="http://www.pollet.net/GLterm/">GLterm</a>.  On a practical level, GLterm is cool because it supports ANSI color right out of the chute.  On a nerd level, GLterm is cool because it uses OpenGL to display everything.  It&#8217;s super fast &#8212; a lot faster than Terminal &#8212; and it feels more like a traditional UNIX terminal because it uses those old-skool fonts.</p>

<p>There are a couple less cool things about it.  It doesn&#8217;t support transparency, which I actually sometimes find practical when I&#8217;m transcribing something from a window behind Terminal.  It also costs $10, which isn&#8217;t a lot, but it feels a little pricey considering it doesn&#8217;t really offer a lot of new features.  So I haven&#8217;t bought it yet, but I&#8217;m thinking about it.  If you&#8217;re a bigtime CLI jockey, though, you might find this just the ticket.</p>

<p>The front-end that <i>kicks ass</i> and <i>takes names</i> is back:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Feature: preview an input track by CTRL+clicking/right-clicking on the input file and selecting &#8220;Play File.&#8221;  This works in the main window, batch encoder, and CD ripper.</li>
<li>New Feature: CD ripper generates a .m3u playlist file.  Turn this on or off in Preferences.</li>
<li>Bug fix: App should no longer crash if the CD ripper is opened while a network drive is mounted</li>
<li>Encoding profile for tracks in batch queue can be changed by highlighting one or more tracks and picking a new profile in the Encoding Profile popup menu.</li>
<li>Stats window opens automatically upon encoding start.  Turn this on or off in Preferences.</li>
<li>Log field in stats window now automatically scrolls to the end when a new entry is added</li>
<li>Most windows can now be closed with CMD+W</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create new encoding profiles to use whatever settings you want.  Just set stuff up as you like in the main window, and go to the &#8220;Profiles&#8221; tab, type in a name, and click &#8220;Save Profile.&#8221;</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t played any videogames in forever.  That&#8217;s probably what&#8217;s been affected the most by having Griffin &#8212; I just don&#8217;t have much in the way of free time, and lately I&#8217;ve been focused on programming.  I&#8217;d like to game more, but normally I might have at most 10 minutes to play before I&#8217;d have to pause to change a diaper/roll him over/clean up vomit.  I feel kind of bad about buying the <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/hardware/networkadaptor/SCPH-10281.asp">PS2 network adapter</a>, because I only played <a href="http://www.sega.com/segasports/games/post_ssgame.jhtml?PRODID=10151">NFL2k3</a> online about 4 times.  Before that I got maybe 40% into <a href="http://www.sega.com/segasports/games/post_ssgame.jhtml?PRODID=10151">GTA:Vice City</a>, and about 70% through <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war3/">Warcraft III</a>, but I haven&#8217;t played any of them in about a month.  Hopefully the boy will be able to pick up a controller soon so we can do some bonding by trying to kill each other&#8217;s avatar.</p>

<p>We visited a house today that looked really, really cool.  Hardwood floors all over the place, 2 big bedrooms, 3 full baths, and a finished basement.  Within our price range (although close to the top), and being sold by the owner.  It&#8217;ll probably go fast, so we&#8217;ll need to make a decision fairly quickly about whether we want to pursue it or not.  It&#8217;s kinda scary to talk about laying out this kind of cash, but all the initial talks with mortgage folks have been really positive.  Apparenlty I have good credit still.  Who woulda thunkit!</p>

<p>When you rip a CD with LameBrain, it does indeed use LAME to encode the file.  OS X makes it really easy to do this by presenting each track on the CD as an .aiff file.  The CD Ripper tool in LameBrain is really just a modified version of the batch encoder, the major difference being the FreeDB functionality.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a new release of LameBrain, intended for debugging feedback in anticipation of an &#8220;official&#8221; release.  This release adds batch encoding capabilities, and had some major rewrites of the code, so if you can take a few minutes and run the program through its paces, that would be super duper.  Just email any problems you find to <a href="mailto:coj@funkatron.com">coj@funkatron.com</a>.</p>

<p>It appears they problem was with my power supply, because as soon as I plugged-in the PS at work, I got my friendly green light and all was better.  This pleases me, because it means I don&#8217;t have to part with my precious Powerbook.  This also kinda miffs me, because the PS that failed was only like a month old &#8212; Apple sent us a replacement when the insulation split up by the plug.</p>

<p>So something went wonky with my Powerbook, either in the power supply or the power plug in the machine itself, because it wouldn&#8217;t take any power when plugged-in.  So now I&#8217;ve got two empty batteries and a dead machine.  Hopefully it&#8217;s just a dead PS, which I can easily replace at work tomorrow.  If not, the machine will probably need to be sent back to Apple.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t realize just how valuable a portable computer is until you suddenly have it taken from you.  The flexibility of being able to go anywhere in our home and be online is super, super nice, especially with a 3 month old.  I also am peeved because without my Powerbook, I can&#8217;t do anything with OS X, which means LameBrain dev is stalled for the time being.</p>

<p>This will probably be a good exercise for me.</p>

<p>If you use Movable Type and are on OS X, you <b>have</b> to check out <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/kunglog.php">Kung-Log</a>, a really smooth desktop app that lets you administrate your blog without using a web browser.  I definitely like writing posts in it better than the web interface, and by using it I bypass all the stupid problems my host has with their CGI install.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can <a href="files/LameBrain.dmg.gz">download the new version</a> directly from my site.  I hope you dig it, and if you have requests or comments, please <a href="mailto:coj@funkatron.com?subject=LameBrain">let me know</a>.  Thanks!</p>

This is a developers preview release, to give interested parties an idea of the direction DBForms2 is headed.  It is by no means feature-complete, and the application may change dramatically before reaching 1.0 status.  Please see the included TO-DO.txt file for more information on future plans.</p>

<p>I do, sorta.  Remember <a href="http://verbosity.wiw.org/issue4/images/adamc2.gif">Adam Curry</a>, the blonde lanky VJ dude?  He&#8217;s some kinda dot-com millionaire, and he has <a href="http://live.curry.com/">a blog</a>.  The blog is mildly interesting, but the best part is his collection of stories about <a href="http://mtv.curry.com/">his MTV days</a>:</p>

<p class="pullquote"> Apparently Ozzie was trying to communicate to us that his problem was larger than he could handle, and a few seconds later I looked up to see Ozzie standing spread eagle in the ilse, with a huge dark spot in his crotch area and a growing pool of urine at his feet.</p>

<p>Curry was a fairly forward-thinkin dude back in the day.  I remember <a href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/Cases/MTV_v_Curry/">the tussle he had with MTV over mtv.com</a> when I was in college.</p>

<p>My major outside-of-work project is a rewrite of DBForms, called <a href="http://otacon.sourceforge.net">DBForms2</a>.  I just finished getting the new version to a state where it actually kinda functions: you can add, edit, and delete database entries in your application.  It&#8217;s still really, really early, but it <b>does</b> work, and that&#8217;s gratifying.</p>

<p>As you may know, I really really like Pro Football.  So today was exciting, because we had the games which determined who would play in next week&#8217;s SuperBowl.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where I can appreciate a good game and a good team without liking or disliking either of the teams involved.  Nevertheless, I do tend to favor one team over the other to some extent, especially when the stakes are as high as they were this week.  Unfortunately, both my preferred teams (the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=ten">Tennessee Titans</a> and the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=phi">Philadelphia Eagles</a>) lost.</p>

<p>Still, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m upset that the teams that won (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=oak">the Raiders</a> and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=tam">the Buccaneers</a>) will be in the SuperBowl.  Gruden <a href="http://msn.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs02/columnist/2003/0119/1495409.html">leaving the Raiders and then meeting them the next year in the SuperBowl</a> is just too interesting.  This will be a good game, although if I were a betting man, I&#8217;d put my money on silver and black &#8212; they just seem like a more complete team.</p>

<p>Funkatron.com is hosted on <a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-958332-1485227">HostRocket</a>.  In general they&#8217;re pretty decent, but they&#8217;re got some problems with their cgi stuff.  As I&#8217;ve stated before, you really want to run Movable Type with a cgi wrapper, because if you don&#8217;t, you have to leave some directories world-writable.  HostRocket has a cgi wrapper, but there are some problems with it that cause MT to throw 500 Internal Server Errors from time to time (like when anyone tries to post a comment).  Can anyone recommend a better inexpensive host that supports MT better?</p>

<p>As for &#8220;inexpensive&#8221;, it&#8217;s all relative, and it depends on your needs. I&#8217;ve been with them for about 3 years and have been pleased. After reading up a bit more on their cgi wrapper stuff, here&#8217;s what they have to say about it:</p>

<p>Normally on a web server, CGI scripts run as the special unix user nobody in the group nogroup. That means that in order for the cgi to write or read files, they must be readable or writable to the world. This isn&#8217;t really that safe, since that means any other user on your server can read and write those files too!
On DreamHost servers, we have a special feature called suexec (which stands for &#8220;switch user execution&#8221;) turned on that makes your CGI scripts on your web site run as though they were run by your user and group!</p>

<p>I wanted to do some more GUI programming, so I started working on a LAME front-end for OS X.  I really like RazorLame for Win32, but since it&#8217;s written in Delphi, I doubt it will be getting ported anytime soon.  This is certainly nowhere near  the quality of that program, but maybe you&#8217;ll like it.</p>

<p>From the video <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Quotes?0273687"><em>Introduction to Scientology</em></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>L. Ron Hubbard:</strong> You have to neglect illness, and the body, and so forth, to improve man.</li>
<li><strong>L. Ron Hubbard:</strong> Psychiatry has to do with the insane, and we have nothing to do with the insane 
whatsoever. The insane &#8212; well, uh, they&#8217;re insane.</li>
<li><strong>L. Ron Hubbard</strong>: I asked them one day, up at Oxford, &#8220;What &#8212; what &#8212; what does &#8216;Scientology&#8217; mean?&#8221; and 
they said &#8212; they &#8212; it means, really, &#8220;the study of knowledge&#8221; or &#8220;I know the word.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Tony Hitchman:</strong> But surely you&#8217;ve only got as much brain as you&#8217;re born with.<br />
<strong>L. Ron Hubbard:</strong> Oh, no &#8212; brain has nothing to do with it. Brain is a sort of a &#8212; well, I don&#8217;t know, brain 
is brain. What it does, I&#8217;m never quite sure.</li>
<li><strong>L. Ron Hubbard:</strong> The insane, and so forth, somebody else can have them, they&#8217;ve already failed.</li>
<li><strong>L. Ron Hubbard:</strong> But that&#8217;s psychotherapy. That&#8217;s for the neurotic, or the person who is insane, or 
something like that. That has nothing to do with Scientology. Scientology is for an able guy like you, or like me, uh, able to 
function in life, able to make his own way, does his work, and so forth - all right, THAT&#8217;S the man that should be helped; 
that&#8217;s the man you should help out, because that fellow is having a hard time, and uh, he&#8217;s got his problems.</li>

<p>I like my Mac a lot.  I use PCs all the time too, but I really enjoy my Mac more. I think it&#8217;s the combination of an elegant 
(although still flawed) GUI and UNIX guts.  I think it also helps that it&#8217;s a laptop, so I can carry it around the house with 
me.  My XP box in the back room doesn&#8217;t get used nearly as much, even though it has a fancy 19&#8221; LCD (a Samsung 191T &#8212; it 
totally rules).</p>

<p />

<p>Anyway, I decided to look into some GUI app dev on OS X. I had an idea, and tried implementing it in several different 
languages:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Applescript Studio</b>: This actually worked pretty well.  The language is SUPER verbose, but eventually I got 
my head around it.  It&#8217;s really easy to build GUI apps with it.  Problem is, the app was pretty unstable &#8212; it would just 
crash without any clear reason.  This may have been improved in newer versions, but it was unusable at the time</li>
 <li><b>Pure Java</b>: I actually got a command-line version of my app going.  That was great.  But I got lost quickly 
with the Swing stuff.  It didn&#8217;t help that all these layout frameworks and shit for Java just seem stupid.  Who would lay out 
a GUI with something that makes your buttons fill all the available space?</li>
 <li><b>Java->ObjC</b>: Total disaster here.  I never got this shit working.</li>
 <li><b>ObjC</b>: What the hell is this crap?  I thought it was C, but the damn syntax looks like some kind of Little 
Orphan Annie Ovaltine code.  A line of code should never start with a -.</li>
 <li><b>RealBasic</b>: You know, there are things I don&#8217;t like about RealBasic, but of all languages, this was by far 
the nicest to work with.  The IDE is really smooth and nicely integrated (the autocomplete on user-defined properties and 
methods is great).  Programming is fun again!</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh yeah, I got the comments working.  Looks like a silly bug with Hostrocket&#8217;s suexec wrapper.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Objective-C syntax is stupid! Both C# &#38; Java, language have reasonably similar OOP constructs (interface, etc), but both chose C++ style syntax (overloading, a.method())! Why?  If they had chosen Objective-C&#8217;s cumbersome syntax [[[obj alloc]init]do something], 99% of the developer woundn&#8217;t give it a second glance ;?)</p>

<p>Features in C++ are there for a reason. How long before you run into a name collision in large projects without namespace especially when you are importing libraries from other sources? How many ways can you write the same sorting routine without using inefficient calls (void* &#38; polymorphic object*) without overloading?
C++ atleast addresses these problems&#8230; Objective-C does not. Its cumbersome syntax does nothing to facilitate the programmer&#8217;s readability except to facilitate the compiler&#8217;s parser. In short, chose a language that lets machine do all the work &#38; not chose a language that helps machine to the work. Wish MacOSX chose these language in following order: C++ -&gt; C# -&gt; Java -&gt; Obj-C. Hell even javascript syntax is more palatable than Obj-C.</p>

<p>I did a new site design for <a href="https://cirdb.cerias.purdue.edu/website/">the CIRDB site</a>.  I just did the design, so 
don&#8217;t give me any credit or blame for the code or content.  It&#8217;s simple, but I like how clean it looks.</p>

<p>So in a lot of ways, Movable Type is pretty damn cool.  In other ways, it&#8217;s not so cool.  If your hosting doesn&#8217;t support 
suexec or some other kind of cgi wrapper, you have to chmod some directories to be world-writable, which is just ASKING for 
trouble if you&#8217;re on a shared host.  But holy hell is the admin system polished.  It makes me never even want to consider 
creating a system like this.</p>

<p>The comments don&#8217;t seem to be working.  I have no idea why not.  I&#8217;ll poke at it some when I get a chance, because I know 
you&#8217;re all chomping at the bit.</p>

<p>Right now my Powerbook tells me it is 10 degrees fahrenheit [happy now chelle? 8)] outside.  It&#8217;s also sunny, which means that 
if it
was not sunny, it would be -700.  I wouldn&#8217;t know either way, because I don&#8217;t go outside &#8212; it&#8217;s overrated.</p>

<p>
Some people will say, &#8220;Ed, why a blog?  What happened to your music
stuff?  Are you a sucker?&#8221;  The answer to the latter should be obvious,
but as for the first two: </p>

<ol>
 <li>I&#8217;m a follower, not a leader</li>
 <li>I haven&#8217;t
written music in a long time, and I&#8217;m not sure I will anytime soon.  I
spend my time programming now, and taking care of my son</li>
</ol>

<p>Back to the weather.  I live in Lafayette, IN, which some people
seem to think is the South.  Anyone from the actual South will laugh in
your face when they see your &#8220;Hoosier by birth, Southern by the grace
of God&#8221; license plate, but some people still insist.  For their sake,
here&#8217;s a helpful cheat sheet to determine if you&#8217;re in the south:</p>

<ul>

 <li>If you balls just froze to your boxers, you&#8217;re not in the south</li>
</ul>

<p>I keep seeing <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cheadle,+Don">Don Cheadle</a> doing these NFL Playoffs commercials.  Now I 
<b>LOVE</b>
Don Cheadle.  He rules.  He&#8217;s one of my favorite actors ever.  But Don
(in case you&#8217;re reading), you&#8217;re not Sam Jackson.  Sam will always be
Jules.  If you&#8217;re gonna do these things, you need to bring Rocket, the
crazy Crip from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094894">Colors</a>, or Mouse, the crazy guy in a suit from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0112857">Devil in a Blue Dress</a>, or Snoopy, the crazy prison inmate from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120780">Out of Sight</a>.  You do not want to bring Buck Swopes from <a 
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118749">Boogie Nights</a>.  Yes, Buck got laid all the time, but he was also a nerd, and 
Raiders fans will beat him up.</p>
