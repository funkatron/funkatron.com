<p>So I&#8217;ve been running <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio/zend_studio_beta?WT.mc_id=HP_studiobeta_1106_L">the new beta of Zend Studio</a>, and a few things are notable:<br /><br />1) It installed properly on my 20&#8221; iMac Core Duo<br />2) The ZDE binary is <b>universal</b>.<br /><br /><img width="267" height="710" src="//funkatron.com/external/ZDE5.5.png" alt="Zend IDE OS X Info Screen" /><br /><br />3) The installer, however, is not.<br /><br /><br />It&#8217;s pretty speedy on the Core Duo.&nbsp; I&#8217;m quite happy with it, and may finally be able to stop running Parallels+XP just to use the ZDE.</p>
