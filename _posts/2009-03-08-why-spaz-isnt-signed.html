<p>We don&#8217;t sign <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> with a code signing certificate generated by one of the 4 (as of this writing) certificate authorities Adobe accepts. This means that when you install Spaz, you get a scary &#8220;Publisher:UNVERIFIED&#8221; warning. This is why we don&#8217;t sign, from a letter I wrote when asked about it in Spring 2008:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I sign Spaz with a paid-for Thawte cert, I am on the hook <em>every</em> year for a Thawte cert. I can&#8217;t change my cert signer or go back to a self-signed cert without breaking auto updating (at least as I understand it), and I&#8217;m therefore locked into a $300 expense every year. That&#8217;s not terrible for a commercial app backed by a company, but that&#8217;s a pretty significant chunk of change for a free, open-source app developed by one person as a hobby to lay out.</p>
  
  <p>I&#8217;m familiar with how certs work, and how Thawte handles certification as compared to other, less expensive cert vendors. Were I convinced that Thawte did some kind of verification process/background checking on the applicant I could see the value, but at least with SSL certs, they certainly didn&#8217;t do anything more than vendors who donate free certs to EDUs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, there are 3 other CAs in addition to Thawte, and the prices range between $180 and $300 per year. Some of these CAs do seem to do a little more background checking. Still, the same arguments apply, especially the one related to cost.</p>

<p>Spaz doesn&#8217;t generate revenue, and relies on donated time from myself and a handful of other generous folks. Committing to a yearly expense in the hundreds of dollars seems unwise.</p>

<p>If this is something you would like to see change, I&#8217;d encourage you to <a href="http://adobe.com/go/wish">ask Adobe</a> to make code signing a realistic option for Free, Open-Source Software like Spaz by providing certificates free-of-charge &#8211; after a reasonable review process &#8211; to projects like ours.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I get that this is an OSS project and that it&#8217;d be an expense regardless, but why not get a GoDaddy one?  I think it&#8217;s much cheaper than $300/yr, which is pretty steep.</p>

<p>I think there are a few others that offer heavily discounted certs that still validate well across a wide set of browsers/etc</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ignoring that I&#8217;d sooner eat my own poo than buy something from GoDaddy, it&#8217;s because code signing certs for AIR are only accepted from the four CAs I mentioned above. And, as I mentioned above, the least expensive option is $180 per year.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ahhh, didn&#8217;t realize so few CAs were accepted by AIR.  Sneaky Adobe!</p>

<p>Hey, may check out your security talk @ SXSW, heading there tomorrow!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It sure doesn&#8217;t seem like they want to encourage open-source apps, then. That&#8217;s a shame,  since I would think the cross-platform aspect of it would be very appealing to people who also tend to like OSS solutions, such as Linux users.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Anthony,</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything &#8220;sneaky&#8221; about what Adobe is doing.  Adobe isn&#8217;t making any money off of developers purchasing certificates, so we have no incentive to require certs from specific vendors.  As a developer myself, I completely understand not wanting to pay for a certificate, but unfortunately that&#8217;s the direction that the software world has gone in.  Adobe didn&#8217;t invent this; we&#8217;re just adhering to current security standards.</p>
