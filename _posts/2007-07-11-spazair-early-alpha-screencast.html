<p><img src="//funkatron.com/images/uploads/spazAIR.png" alt="spazAIR.png" border="0" width="124" height="147" align="right" />So I&#8217;m basically rewriting <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> as an <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">AIR</a> app.  You get a ton of wins with AIR, the biggest for me being the ability to leverage my web skillz to write a desktop app.  Some folks may not realize that <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/develop_ajax.html">AIR allows you to write apps in pure HTML+JS</a> &#8212; no Flash, no Flex.  This is a Big Win for me, and a lot of other folks, I think.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using to write Spaz.AIR:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dreamweaver (although you really don&#8217;t need to &#8212; it just makes packaging the app a bit easier)</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry JS Framework, v1.5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a></li>
<li>Plain old HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I recorded a <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/spaz/AIR/spaz.AIR-earlyAlpha.mp4">screencast</a> of a <em>very</em> early alpha version of Spaz.AIR.  <strike>The file is <strong>big</strong>, because I wanted high quality but also something my poor 12&#8221; Powerbook could actually handle recording</strike> I was having trouble with playback on Windows, so I converted the file to mp4 via Quicktime Pro.  Now it&#8217;s 9MB instead of 290MB, and looks almost identical.</p>
