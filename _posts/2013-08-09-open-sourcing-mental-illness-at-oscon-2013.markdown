I was so happy to be able to give the Open Sourcing Mental Illness talk at OSCON 2013. This is one of the conferences I would not have been able to attend without financial support from the Indiegogo campaign -- flight and hotel alone were nearly $1500.

I was pleased with how this presentation went. Despite the fact that it was in the last time slot of the conference, there was good attendance and lots of interesting discussion afterwards.

We also did a [BlueHackers](http://bluehackers.org/) BoF session again, which I co-hosted with [Paul Fenwick](https://twitter.com/pjf). Paul gave an excellent talk called ["Depression â€“ Bugs In Your Brain"](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/31518), they day before, and lots of what he discussed came up in the conversations. It was another really positive experience, and I definitely plan to keep doing these BoF sessions when possible.

Next up are:
