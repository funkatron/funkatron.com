I wrote an article for this year's [WebAdvent](http://webadvent.org) (previously PHPAdvent) called ["More Code, Mode Problems."](http://webadvent.org/201210) It expands on the MicroPHP Manifesto I wrote early this year and applies it to other languages, establishing a set of principles for creating clear, reusable code.

Please [go there](http://webadvent.org/201210) to read it, but you can leave comments here if you like.
