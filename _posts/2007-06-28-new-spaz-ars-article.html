<p><img src="//funkatron.com/content/uploads/spaz-qs.png" alt="Spaz Icon" width="155" height="158" border="1" align="right" />It&#8217;s been a while, but I&#8217;m back on the <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz" title="Spaz, the multiuser Twitter client for OS X, Windows and Linux">Spaz</a> development bandwagon again. The newest release is 0.3.2, and it adds a few new things:</p>

<ul>
<li>added new right-click/ctrl+click menus on messages.</li>
<li>changed double-click action: starts reply to user, unless double-clicking
on a direct message, in which case it starts a dm.</li>
<li>Fixed/added direct message reading</li>
<li>Added &#8220;replies&#8221; support</li>
<li>Added &#8220;featured&#8221; support</li>
<li>Increased depth of message boxes to handle larger sizes</li>
<li>Switched to multiline output of statuses.  All statuses should now be
fully readable.</li>
<li>Removed rounded rects from Windows version because standard drawing funcs
look horrible
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/06/28/spaz-the-other-twitter-client-for-os-x-and-windows-and-linux" title="Spaz: the other Twitter client for OS X (and Windows, and Linux)">a great article on Spaz at ArsTechnica</a>, a site I&#8217;ve been reading for many, many years now.
