<p>I&#8217;ve been working at <a href="http://purdue.edu">Purdue</a> for over 6 years now, and I have to say that I&#8217;ve enjoyed it immensely. While the experience can vary from department to department, in general it&#8217;s a fairly low-pressure environment with a lot of opportunities to learn and develop new skills for motivated folks. Purdue offers great benefits, and the Greater Lafayette area is a pretty cool, decently progressive environment considering the size &#8211; US News &amp; World Report recently picked West Lafayette one of <a href="http://www.usnews.com/listings/retirement/indiana/west_lafayette">the &#8220;Best Places to Retire&#8221; in the US</a>.</p>

<p>A job just opened up in the Math department for <a href="http://purdue.taleo.net/careersection/wl/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&amp;job=42620">a &#8220;Web Programmer/Analyst&#8221;</a>. This position calls for strong PHP, PostgreSQL and MySQL skills; Linux and Unix fu (you should be able to admin the web stack); good communication skills (you&#8217;ll be working with a number of different people with varying tech backgrounds); and plenty of independent motivation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not involved in the hiring process at all, but I&#8217;m friends with those who are, so if you have specific questions, I can route them to the right person. Please <em>email me directly</em> &#8211; do not post questions in the comments.</p>
