<p><img src="//funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/thatsagoodgirl.jpg" border="1" /><br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6248975.stm">A story on the BBC site</a> talks about a for-TV experiment where 9 limey suckers were tossed in a tent and forced to eat plants.  The results?<br /><br />- Avg 10lbs lost<br />- Blood pressure dropped about 20/10 pts<br />- Cholesterol down 23%<br /><br />Confusingly, the article also mentions people weighing &#8220;stone,&#8221; which may indicate a fossilization side-effect of the diet.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>LOL Surely you&#8217;re joking? Or have most Americans really never heard of the unit of weight (commonly used for reporting how much a person weighs in the UK) called the &#8220;stone&#8221;?</p>

<p>From the built-in Mac OS X dictionary:</p>

<h2>stone: 4 ( pl. same) Brit. a unit of weight equal to 14 pounds (6.35 kg) : I weighed 10 stone.</h2>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you&#8217;d probably run into a <em>lot</em> of Americans who have no idea that a &#8220;stone&#8221; is a unit of measurement, but I actually was joking. 8)</p>
