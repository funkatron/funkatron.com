<p>A friend of mine asked me today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have my own idea for a mobile and desktop app.</p>
  
  <p>Would you have any recommendation on what SDKs to use? I&#8217;d like to use as few as possible and get cross platform as possible. The app is simple, it basically connects to a web service, gets data, and makes charts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get this kind of question a lot, so I thought I&#8217;d share what I wrote to him:</p>

<p>There are a couple options for app frameworks, and on one framework there are a bunch of options for UI/DOM frameworks.</p>

<p>First off, the cross-platform mobile frameworks I know about are JavaScript-based. I know at least one which is game-oriented and uses Lua, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;re doing game dev.  So, you&#8217;ll need to be doing your work in JS at least, and possibly JS/HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>There are really two solid options I see for locally-installed apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/">Appcelerator Titanium Mobile</a>: focuses on native-looking apps; essentially a JavaScript bridge to the native platform on iOS and Android. They&#8217;re close to having Blackberry available too. This works well if you really need to use truly native UI widgets and only need those top 2-3 platforms, and/or need deeper integration into native APIs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>: Basically a packager that takes a webkit browser app and encapsulates it into a package to install locally on your device. Has <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/about">much wider support for different platforms</a>, but only hooks into the most common native APIs. Also doesn&#8217;t provide any kind of UI toolkit &#8212; it&#8217;s all Webkit, so you make your own choices for a DOM framework. Mobile web frameworks to look at include <a href="http://joapp.com/">Jo</a>, <a href="http://xuijs.com/">xui</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a>, <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a>, and others.  Or, you just build it yourself with custom HTML/CSS/JS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
