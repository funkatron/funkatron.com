<p><img src="//funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/ffsc-pouting-child.jpg" border="0" height="180" width="260" alt="FFSC_Pouting-child.jpg" align="right" />I&#8217;m pretty bummed: I won&#8217;t be able to go to OSCON this year.  I got the standard rejection letter for my talk proposal on <a href="http://PhpSecInfo.com/">PHPSecInfo</a>.  It&#8217;s kind of frustrating, not just because this means there&#8217;s no way I can go (I can&#8217;t afford to send myself, and it&#8217;s not in the work budget), but because there&#8217;s no feedback given at all.  I understand why they don&#8217;t, but I wish I knew more about why I didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>

<p>Phooey.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I got rejected also. While a reason wasn&#8217;t given, I know it was because it wasn&#8217;t a case study.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t care. The only reason I submit to OSCON is to see the non-PHP talks when I&#8217;m not working on my slide deck.</p>

<h2>Honestly, I could talk for hours about the issues we have keeping Tagged up and architecting it, but I suppose they just want another six talks on how to use HTML_QuickForm, PDO, or write your own extension. :-D</h2>
