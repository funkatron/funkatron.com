<p>I really don&#8217;t like to toot my own horn. Well, actually I do, but I&#8217;m also embarassed by it, so writing the title for this post was a bit painful. Nevertheless, I do think it&#8217;s accurate: Spaz webOS 1.0 is now available in the Palm App Catalog, and that&#8217;s a significant milestone for the project, and for open source on webOS.</p>

<p>I first started playing with webOS a year ago, over Christmas break at my day job. In June, Spaz webOS was in the App Catalog at release, and back then I was quite proud of the fact that we&#8217;d been able to ship a truly open source, transparent app on the first day of a new platform. And now, a year since I first cobbled together a Hello World in Mojo, Spaz has reached a reasonable level of maturity &#8211; at least as mature as something called &#8220;Spaz&#8221; will ever have.</p>

<p>Originally I was going to call this release v0.6. I am shy of using 1.0 because I am painfully aware of all the flaws in my software, and it certainly never feels &#8220;done&#8221; or &#8220;ready&#8221; to me. However, a recent discussion with <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog">Keith Casey</a> led me to think more seriously about using the &#8220;1.0&#8221; designation &#8211;&#160;Spaz webOS is very much Safe To Use, but a pre-1.0 version might make some potential users to think otherwise.</p>

<p>And potential users are a bit more of a consideration now, because in a couple weeks (probably the week of January 11), <strong>Spaz webOS will start charging $2 for App Catalog downloads in the United States</strong>. This is something I&#8217;ve been planning for a while, but it&#8217;s still stepping out a bit, both for me (I&#8217;ve never charged for software before) and for open source software in general. To be clear, here&#8217;s how it will work:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Spaz webOS will cost $2 to download in App Catalog markets that support payments</strong>. Right now the only market that supports payments is the US.  It will be free in all other markets.</li>
<li><strong>Spaz will still be completely open source.</strong> <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">The full source code</a> will always be available.</li>
<li><strong>I will not stop users from packaging and installing Spaz webOS themselves.</strong> In fact, I encourage it! I always need more testers, designers and developers. Hacking, patching, and messing with Spaz are fully endorsed. If you can&#8217;t help in one of these ways, consider <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore">donating to the SpazCore project</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue made from paid App Catalog downloads will be used to support development and offset equipment and hosting costs.</strong> I&#8217;ve never made any money from Spaz, and despite some generous donations over the past couple years, I&#8217;m still well in the red. I don&#8217;t do this for the money (obviously), but lightening the burden and compensating myself and other people who have given their time for Spaz is reasonable, I think.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another thing that isn&#8217;t changing is the principles that guide the Spaz project. I wrote up a <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/the-spaz-project-statement-of-purpose/">statement of purpose</a> a while, back, which I&#8217;ll replicate here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Spaz was built for the sake of building it. It is not a means to an end. However, creating it has had several good consequences.</li>
  <li>Spaz demonstrates that making things is good, and sharing how you make them is better.</li>
  <li>Spaz is a necessary counter to closed, hidden technologies. Spaz must always be open.</li>
  <li>The value of Spaz does not lie in the judgements of others, but in the process of building it, and the enjoyment derived by those who use it.</li>
  <li>We welcome anyone who wishes to participate in the Spaz Project with open arms, as long as they understand and respect the purposes of the project.</li>
  <li>The Spaz project values clear and open communication between participants.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is how I think software should be made</strong>. If you agree, I hope you&#8217;ll consider supporting what we&#8217;re doing in a way you see fit. We always need help!</p>

<p>Thank you for making Spaz far more than I could have imagined.</p>
