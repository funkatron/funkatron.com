The last remnants of Atari Games, the coin-op developer that spun of from the console-making atari in 1984 (I think), died with the closing of Midway Games West this month.  This inspired Gamespy to do a <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/top10/february03/atari/">roundup on what they consider the 10 best Atari games to ever grace arcades</a>.  Since I&#8217;m all about never getting over my past, I loved this article.  You should too.</p>
