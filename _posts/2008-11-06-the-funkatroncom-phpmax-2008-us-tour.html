<p>The coming weeks are gonna be a little hectic for me, as I fly to Atlanta on the 12th to attend <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/">php|works / PyWorks 2008</a>. I&#8217;ll be doing the following talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s3/1">Building Desktop RIAs with PHP, HTML and Javascript in AIR</a></li>
<li><a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s7/1">The CodeIgniter Framework</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited about <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/">php|works / PyWorks 2008</a>, especially because we can interact with the Python community and learn more about each other&#8217;s tech. Cross-pollination is a Good Thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m flying back to IND on the 15th, but then I&#8217;m leaving again on the 16th for San Francisco and the <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na">Adobe MAX 2008 conference</a>. I&#8217;m giving the following talk:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#754">Developing Rich Applications with jQuery and Adobe AIR</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Originally this talk was going to be given by <a href="http://ejohn.org">John Resig</a>, creator of the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> library, but he ran into some time constraints and thoughtfully suggested me. Of course, the description still mentions his name, which likely means I&#8217;ll be tarred and feathered by the audience. This also looks like it may be the largest audience I&#8217;ve ever given a talk before: there are currently about 70 folks listed as attending, with ~300 capacity. So if I wet myself on stage, please forgive me.</p>
