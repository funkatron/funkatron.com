<p>Clearly the free booze and other gifts provided to the <a href="http://phparch.com">php|arch</a> team is paying off, as two of my talks have been accepted for <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek 2008</a> in Chicago. I&#8217;ll be speaking on desktop app development with <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">AIR</a>, and the <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> project.  <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/c/schedule">The full schedule of talks</a> will help you plan on how best to avoid me.</p>

<p>Desktop app dev with <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">AIR</a> has been something near and dear to my heart lately, as I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in the past several months developing <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client based on AIR.  In the process I&#8217;ve learned a whole heck of a lot about Javascript development, and learned intimately what works well in AIR and what doesn&#8217;t. Combining PHP on the server side and Javascript/HTML on the client side makes a lot of sense for me, then. Getting the two sides to work together has gotten a fair bit easier with the <a href="http://php.net/json">JSON extension</a> that was added in PHP 5.2.0.  With that, exchange of data structures carries a lot less overhead.</p>

<p><a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> has been quiet for a while on the development side, but I&#8217;m hoping things will pick up a bit with the introduction of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpsecinfo">public SVN access</a> to the project. The trunk version has some extra stuff in it, like the beginnings of a new view system to output results in various formats.  I&#8217;ve also added <a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com/">Paul Reinheimer</a> as a contributor, so feel free to guilt him into making updates as well.  If you&#8217;re interested in contributing patches or updates to PHPSecInfo, drop me a line and we&#8217;ll chat.</p>
