<p>Our move to using oAuth for authentication in Spaz is going well. Many people have stepped up to help get the <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore">SpazCore</a> libraries working, and <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-desktop-air">Spaz Desktop</a> has been updated to use the new authentication methods, both in the 0.8 branch and master.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">Spaz webOS</a> still hasn&#8217;t had work done on it to get oAuth working. July 16th is the Twitter Basic Auth cutoff, so we don&#8217;t have much time.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the big news: <strong>Palm has donated Palm Pre Plus phones for AT&amp;T for me to GIVE AWAY to the top 3 contributors to Spaz webOS from now until July 12</strong>. That&#8217;s the day (I believe) we <em>need</em> to submit Spaz webOS to Palm for review, so it can be ready by the 16th.</p>

<p>So, you want a free phone? Get your ass in gear. Download the SDK now:

<p>To get through Palm&#8217;s review process, I believe we need to submit by July 12th. So before then, two things need to happen in Spaz webOS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter accounts need to use oAuth to authenticate, using xAuth to exchange username/password for auth keys initially </li>
<li>Image uploaders need to use oAuth Echo to post </li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;ve already accomplished this in the Spaz Desktop 0.8 branch, so doing it in webOS is very doable. Whether it gets done in time is up to you. I am <a href="http://twitter.com/funkatron">on Twitter</a>, available via email, and in #spaz on irc.freenode.net regularly to answer any questions.</p>

<p>Palm has been a major supporter of open source, and Spaz is (AFAICT)  the only open source microblogging client available on the platform. Help me keep it going, please.</p>
