<p><a href="http://works.phparch.com/">php|works 2007</a> was last week, and it was a great experience for me.  Here are the slides and code from the presentations I gave:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/EdFinkler-Introduction%20to%20CodeIgniter.pdf">Introduction to CodeIgniter</a></strong>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/CI-talk.zip">Example app used in talk &#8212; includes CodeIgniter and ZendFramework</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/EdFinkler-Securing%20the%20PHP%20Environment%20With%20PhpSecInfo.pdf">Securing the PHP Environment With PHPSecInfo</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoyed my trip to Atlanta and the conference experience. Much like php|tek this year in Chicago, &#8216;works was filled with lots of great content, smart people, and a casual, comfortable atmosphere that makes the whole thing a lot of fun. The <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a> conferences lack pretension, and that&#8217;s really nice &#8212; it&#8217;s about the people and sharing knowledge. And this one was really special for me because it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve given a presentation to my colleagues in the community.  I was very nervous, but it all turned out well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to write out an extended journal of the whole experience, but here are some memorable moments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being sick just two days before I was about to leave, and getting better just in time to go</li>
<li>Having my first flight cancelled, giving me time to mostly finish my CodeIgniter talk before I left the Indy airport</li>
<li>Getting to the hotel just in time to catch <a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett</a>&#8217;s funny PHP4 is Dead keynote</li>
<li>Discovering the hotel room had a flat-panel TV. Unfortunately, no HD content</li>
<li>Catching up with Lucas Nealan, and getting an unexpected phonecall with great news</li>
<li>The fact that there were about 7,000 iPhones on-hand</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.preinheimer.com/">Paul Reinheimer</a> quad-core drinking demo (sponsored by Microsoft)</li>
<li><em>Ramblecast</em>: the loudest, drunkest, least productive group podcasting experiment ever</li>
<li>Learning a lot more about <a href="http://php.net/filter">the Filter extension</a> from <a href="http://www.derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and seeing how it compares to <a href="http://inspekt.org">Inspekt</a></li>
<li>Losing power in the middle of my <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PHPSecInfo</a> talk, and <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a> resuscitating the projector</li>
<li><a href="http://terrychay.com">Terry Chay</a>&#8217;s software architecture talk. I didn&#8217;t agree with everything he said, but I laughed my ass off</li>
<li>Meeting people who have actually heard of me and used tools I&#8217;ve made. Weird</li>
<li>Good conversations with too many people to name</li>
</ul>
