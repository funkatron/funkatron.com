<p>Through an apparent clerical error, I&#8217;ve been chosen to speak at <a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/p/index" title="Harness the Power of PHP, or something">php|works Atlanta</a> on September 12-13.  I&#8217;ll be speaking on <a href="http://PhpSecInfo.com" title="PhpSecInfo provides an equivalent to the phpinfo() function that reports security information about the PHP environment, and offers suggestions for improvement.">PHPSecInfo</a>, the PHP environment security auditing tool.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed php|tek Chicago this May, which was my first <a href="http://www.phparch.com/" title="Write something about mayonaise and PHP here">PHP Architect</a> conference, and I trust this one will be just as cool, with talks from folks like <a href="http://benramsey.com/" title="I'm jealous of him because he has way more feed subscribers than me">Ben Ramsey</a>, <a href="http://eliw.com/" title="Note: lay off the Digg jokes">Eli White</a>, <a href="http://shiflett.org/" title="Try not to be sick this time">Chris Shiflett</a>, and <a href="http://www.terrychay.com/blog/" title="Mothafuckin'">Terry Chay</a>.  Terry and I will also be competing in the first annual PHP offend-off, where we see who can most efficiently insult the sensibilities of a room full of attendees.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been father south than D.C., so I&#8217;m interested to see what the land of Andre 3000 is like.</p>
