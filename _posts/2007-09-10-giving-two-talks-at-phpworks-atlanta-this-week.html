<p>This Friday, I&#8217;ll be giving two talks at <a href="http://works.phparch.com">php|works Atlanta</a>: one on <a href="http://codeigniter.com">the CodeIgniter framework</a>, and one on <a href="http://phpsecinfo.com">PhpSecInfo</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/schedule/talk/d2s4/2">Intro to CodeIgniter</a></h3>

<p><em>September 14, 2007 @ 1:15 &#8211; 2:15pm</em></p>

<p>CodeIgniter is an open-source web application framework written in PHP. Created by EllisLab, CI is descended from the ExpressionEngine CMS system, and therefore has a focus on real-world needs and solutions for PHP developers. CI is easy to deploy, and works with a wide variety of environments (even FTP-only shared hosting accounts). It offers powerful features like MVC and ActiveRecord without requiring the developer to adhere to strict coding guidelines. It&#8217;s easy to extend, and plays well with other code libraries like PEAR and Zend Framework.</p>

<p>In this talk we&#8217;ll go over the basics of CI: how to deploy it and writing a simple application. As time allows, we&#8217;ll discuss how to extend the framework with other libraries.</p>

<h3><a href="http://works.phparch.com">Securing the PHP Environment With PhpSecInfo</a></h3>

<p><em>September 14, 2007 @ 4:30 &#8211; 5:30pm</em></p>

<p>PhpSecInfo is an easy to use security auditing tool for the PHP Environment. We&#8217;ll discuss how to use PhpSecInfo as part of your web app security toolkit, and how to customize and extend it for your specific needs, including using the Zend_Environment_Security module from the Zend Framework.</p>
