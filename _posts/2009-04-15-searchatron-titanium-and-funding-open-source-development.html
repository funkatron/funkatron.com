<p>A few of you may know of a small app I did in AIR a while back called
Searchatron. It&#8217;s mostly a proof of concept, but does have some
usefulness in making it a bit easier to track multiple Twitter search
queries. <a href="http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3">Searchatron</a> uses an MVC-style pattern similar to how the next
version of <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> will be built, and much of Searchatron&#8217;s code provided
the basis for the <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spazcore/">SpazCore</a> component library.</p>

<p>As more of you may know, I&#8217;m very interested in the new <a href="http://Titaniumapp.com">Titanium</a>
platform. It&#8217;s similar to AIR, but fully open-source, and much more
extensible. In order to learn more about Titanium, I tasked myself
last week with converting Searchatron from AIR to Titanium. The whole
process only took a couple hours. You can download the result from
<a href="http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3">http://get.titaniumapp.com/app/12GKqr3</a>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that <a href="http://appcelerant.com">Appcelerator</a>, the creators of the Titanium
platform, are running a contest right now. Two $500 prizes will be
awarded for the most downloaded app, and the highest-rated app,
respectively. If Searchatron wins either of these prizes, I&#8217;m pledging
now to use the prize money to support further development of Spaz and
the SpazCore project, in the form of cash gifts to our most giving
volunteers. It might not be a lot, but it does mean <em>real money</em> is
going to people working on open-source development. I hope to continue
doing so when feasible and prudent.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping, this one is pretty easy: download
Searchatron, and if you like it, suggest others do the same. Feel free
to point them here if you like. By doing so, you&#8217;ll be doing a lot to
encourage the continued development Spaz and its related projects.</p>
