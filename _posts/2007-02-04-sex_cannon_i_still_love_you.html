And hold onto the ball.  And throw to open people.  And not throw off your back foot.<br /><br />Dammit, Berrian had them <em>beat</em>, and if Grossman hadn&#8217;t underthrown the ball by 10 yards, it&#8217;s a 4 point game with 9 minutes left.<br /><br />Well, Peyton needed to win one.  But him getting the MVP was horseshit &#8212; Rhodes or Addai deserved it more.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not sure what the Bears should do with Grossman next year.  If he makes serious improvement in his mechanics, then he could be top-notch.  For now, though, he&#8217;s a liability.</p>

<p>(Edit: Jesus, I wrote &#8220;won&#8221; instead of &#8220;one.&#8221;)</p>
