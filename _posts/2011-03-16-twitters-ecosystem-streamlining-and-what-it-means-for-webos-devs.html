<p>I had a really fun time the other night on the <a href="http://www.webosroundup.com/">webOSRoundup</a> live podcast recording. We do it over Skype + UStream, so folks in the chat can watch us while we dick around and try to fix technical issues. I love doing stuff like this because I get to act like I know what I&#8217;m talking about &#8211;&#160;it&#8217;s a lot like this blog in that respect.</p>

<p>One of the major topics of discussion was <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/twitter-development-talk/yCzVnHqHIWo/discussion">a recent announcement</a> to the Twitter developer community about the way users interact with Twitter, and where developers should focus their efforts. There were also updates to the API TOS, but that really didn&#8217;t change much. The &#8220;money quote&#8221; was in the letter, signed by Ryan Sarver, that went out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230;developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. &#160;The answer is no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While follow-up discussion has basically been Twitter employees saying &#8220;oh, we didn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t, just that you probably won&#8217;t make money doing it.&#8221; While the folks posting this probably believe that, I think the folks who actually control what Twitter does meant what was said. And what was said was &#8220;you should not make client apps,&#8221; and not &#8220;you probably won&#8217;t make money making client apps.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lot of people have asked if this means 3rd party client apps are <em>banned</em>. No, not at the moment. But Twitter&#8217;s overriding purpose is to make their investors money, and if it becomes more lucrative to ban 3rd party clients outright, or restrict API access to blessed or paying developers, I have no doubt the company will do so. People have short attention spans, and if Twitter is still around in 2 years, things may have changed enough where they don&#8217;t care so much that they can&#8217;t use Tweetdeck.</p>

<p>The second point that came up in this discussion was how this affects webOS. There is no official client on webOS, but there is a very active set of 3rd-party devs who work on clients, including myself with Spaz. Right now, I believe there&#8217;s no official client simply because Twitter doesn&#8217;t care about webOS. At the moment, webOS market share is too low to matter to them. When that changes, they will be more interested in it.</p>

<p>And rest assured, HP Palm wants an official client. It&#8217;s in a list of apps they want, like Netflix and Skype. If HP/P has to build it themselves and just have the approval of Twitter (Twitter certainly doesn&#8217;t build all their official clients in-house), they will &#8211;&#160;like they did with FaceBook.</p>

<p>What does that mean for the various independently-developed Twitter clients? Probably that they will need to be accept that their products will be niche. I&#8217;m speculating, but I suspect HP/P will not put much effort into promoting 3rd party clients. There&#8217;s a good chance an official Twitter app will be pre-installed as well, which means many (most?) users won&#8217;t bother looking in the App Catalog for another option.</p>

<p>Does that mean you&#8217;re screwed? No. But it means you&#8217;re gonna have to accept a role as a &#8220;hobbyist&#8221; rather than trying to make this your day job. <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html">As Alex Payne said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get cozy with [Twitter], or work at arm&#8217;s length. Operating in between the hobbyist and professional roles could be difficult, and developers may be understandably frustrated as they&#8217;re forced to rethink their projects and products</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose it&#8217;s possible that HP/P might pluck some lucky indie developer out of obscurity and bring them on to develop the official client. More power to that person if it happens. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy removing features from your client and making space for ads.</p>

<p>Me, I&#8217;ll keep making Spaz, and improving its interoperability with other microblogging systems like the StatusNet-based Identi.ca. I&#8217;ve never made money on Spaz, and I like it that way &#8212; it keeps me focused on doing the right thing, not what will improve my financial position.</p>

<p>Luckily I can do that, but not everyone can, and those webOS developers who rely on their Twitter apps for income would be well-advised to consider whether their want to tie their success to a single company anymore &#8212; a company with which they have no financial relationship, and one that has clearly stated their intent to control the end-user market.</p>
