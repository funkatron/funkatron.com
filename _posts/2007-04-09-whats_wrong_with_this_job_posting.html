<blockquote><strong>Company</strong> Warner Bros. Records
<strong>Location</strong> Burbank, CA
<strong>Title</strong> PHP Developer
<strong>Summary </strong>
Warner Brothers Records is looking for a freelance PHP developer skilled in Drupal themeing and programming. To be considered you must be able to work at our office, <strong><em>provide your own computer</em></strong> and be very comfortable developing using SVN.

You&#8217;ll be in New Media, a very relaxed work environment, with cool and quirky people. We prize Mac users but welcome all. This is a great chance to work with bands like Arctic Monkeys, White Stripes, Damien Rice, Muse and more.

To apply please send an e-mail with the following to nmtech@warnerbrosrecords.com:

<ul>
<li>PHP Developer and your full name in the Subject line.</li>
<li>3 Links to actual code you have written and or sites worked on what you worked on.</li>
<li>Tell us a little about yourself and send a link to your blog you have one.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>Lemme get this straight: I have to work at your office, but <em>provide my own computer???</em>  This reads like a really slimy way of getting people to work cheap in exchange for <em>maybe</em> doing a web site for some half-wit modern &#8220;rock&#8221; band.  I&#8217;ll keep my iMac at home and make more money doing contracting work, but thanks all the same, WB.</p>
