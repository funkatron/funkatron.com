<p><a href="http://phpcon.org/" title="PHP Community Conference - April 21-22 - Nashville, TN"><img src="//funkatron.com/images/phpcomcon.png" alt="PHP Community Conference" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing conferences since July of 2006, when I attended <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/muntoh/207352244/">OSCON in Portland, OR</a>. Since then I&#8217;ve been to 4 or 5 a year, mostly as a speaker (#humblebrag) but sometimes as an attendee plebian as well.  They have included joints like:</p>

<ul>
<li>OSCON</li>
<li><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a></li>
<li>SXSWi</li>
<li>php|tek &amp; works</li>
<li><a href="http://BrooklynBeta.org">Brooklyn Beta</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#8217;ve gotten to see quite a range of conferences, from 10,000 people at SXSW, to 150 people at Brooklyn Beta. And after several years of this, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that the best conferences are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intimate</li>
<li>Intelligent</li>
<li>Welcoming</li>
<li>Focus on sharing and learning from one another</li>
</ul>

<p>With conferences like this, there&#8217;s a lot less separation between speaker and attendee, which I like a lot. I personally LOVE jabbering with anyone who wants to hear me, so I love it when attendees come up and ask questions or share their own experiences with me. And this is a LOT easier at smaller conferences that actively encourage this kind of atmosphere.</p>

<p>Last year, I attended two conferences that met those criteria for me: Open Source Bridge and Brooklyn Beta. Both of them were small, volunteer-driven, not profit-motivated, and intimate. The people who attended were across the board there because they love what they do. They love making great things,  sharing what they create, and sharing <em>how</em> they create. And that&#8217;s why everyone was there.</p>

<p>So I am <em>very</em> excited that some dedicated folks are trying to bring this kind of experience to the PHP community. <strong><a href="http://phpcon.org/">The PHP Community Conference</a> on April 21-22 in Nashville, TN</strong> is going to be an intimate, friendly, intelligent conference for folks who use PHP. You&#8217;ll learn new stuff about a variety of topics, from technical PHP issues to open source community building.</p>

<p>Plus, how often do <a href="http://phpcon.org/speakers">speakers</a> like Rasmus Lerdorf, Andrei Zmievski, Lorna Mitchell and Terry Chay come to Nashville? For once you can attend a top-notch PHP conference that isn&#8217;t on the west coast or Chicago.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m speaking as well, but what I&#8217;m most excited about is being able to learn and share with other folks who love building things with PHP. <strong>I&#8217;m confident that this will be the best PHP conference of 2011</strong>. And I hope you&#8217;ll be there so I can meet you and talk about the awesome stuff <em>you&#8217;re</em> doing.</p>
