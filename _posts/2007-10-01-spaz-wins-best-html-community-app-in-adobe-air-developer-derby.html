<p>I am pleased as punch to finally be able to announce publicly that <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client I developed in HTML and Javascript for the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe Integrated Runtime</a>, has won <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/air_derby_winners.html">&#8220;Best HTML Community Application&#8221;</a> in the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/showcase/special/airderby/">AIR Develper Derby</a>.</p>

<p>I submitted Spaz as something of an afterthought, to be honest. I had received some good feedback on it from a couple people at Adobe, but I didn&#8217;t think it was <em>all that</em>, so to speak.  Throughout the development process I avoided looking at what other developers were doing, especially other Twitter devs, because I was sure it would send me into a tailspin of despair at the bush league-ness of my own kung fu.  After all, Spaz is the first &#8220;Rich Internet Application&#8221; I&#8217;ve written. I hadn&#8217;t even written an AJAX call in any code up until Spaz.</p>

<p>So, receiving this award is a great surprise to me, and very encouraging.  There are a lot of <em>great</em> Twitter clients out there, and this makes me believe that Spaz is at least in the ballpark.  Or, as <a href="http://www.calevans.com/">Cal Evans</a> put it far more succinctly, &#8220;Spaz doesn&#8217;t suck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks to all the users of Spaz, and everyone who has given me feedback. I wrote Spaz because I wanted people to <em>use</em> it, and everyone who does gives me a great deal of encouragement.  And very special thanks to those who have given me feedback &#8212; Spaz is an &#8220;award-winning&#8221; app thanks to you.</p>

<p>BTW, I&#8217;m at <a href="http://www.adobemax2007.com/na/">AdobeMAX2007</a> in Chicago now, so if you&#8217;re an attendee and want to chat about Spaz, drop me a line.</p>

<p>Now, onward to <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html">AIR Beta 2</a>!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Huzzah!  Nice job.  Thanks for making the best Twitter client for Windows, hands down (and a good option on OS X).  Adobe just needs to catch up with AIR releases!  Looking forward to Linux support.</p>

<p>Congrats again, and good luck with the album release.  Maybe that&#8217;ll get a Greammy and you can fold your tent for the rest of the year.</p>
