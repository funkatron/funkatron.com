<p><img src="//funkatron.com/blog/images/thora2_thumb.jpg" height="160" width="200" align="right" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="I'm an indie goddess" />I had some free time tonight, and I didn&#8217;t feel like coding, so I did some design work.  The result is my second in the series of Thora Birch desktop wallpapers.  As before, they come in jpg and tiff flavors. <a href="mailto:coj@funkatron.com">Let me know what you think</a>!</p>

<li><a href="wallpaper/thora2.tif">Phat TIFF Version</a></li>
