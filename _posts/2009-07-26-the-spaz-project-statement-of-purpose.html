<p>This is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about and working on for a few weeks now. I wanted to post it here both to understand my motivation, and to hear feedback.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spaz was built for the sake of building it. It is not a means to an end. However, creating it has had several good consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaz demonstrates that making things is good, and sharing how you make them is better.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaz is a necessary counter to closed, hidden technologies. Spaz must always be open.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of Spaz does not lie in the judgements of others, but in the process of building it, and the enjoyment derived by those who use it.</p></li>
<li><p>We welcome anyone who wishes to participate in the Spaz Project with open arms, as long as they understand and respect the purposes of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>The Spaz project values clear and open communication between participants.</p></li>
</ol>
