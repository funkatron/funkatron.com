I have a <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com">new web host</a>.  Why?  Because Hostrocket left an exploit on their servers which was exploited to <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=124584">deface many of their customers&#8217; sites</a>, including my site and 2 of my clients&#8217; sites.  When I inquired about a refund for this massive screwup (a free month&#8217;s hosting seemed not unreasonable), they told me they won&#8217;t be giving refunds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had problems with HR, but it&#8217;s gonna be the last.  If they can&#8217;t throw their customers a bone after totally dropping the ball security-wise (<a href="http://security-archive.merton.ox.ac.uk/archive-200111/0352.html">again</a>), they clearly don&#8217;t deserve my business.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t think they deserve your business.  So screw &#8216;em.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PS: One more cool thing about the switch: MT actually functions correctly.  No more 500 errors.  Hooray!</p>
