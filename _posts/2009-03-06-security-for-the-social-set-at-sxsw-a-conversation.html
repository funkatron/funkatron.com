Do you develop social networking sites? Do you like it when people do <em>not</em> hack your Facebook account?  If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to one of the above, then you simply <em>must</em> attend <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/core_conversations?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901250"><strong>Security for the Social Set</strong>, a Core Conversation</a> I&#8217;m leading at SXSW. It will take place on Sunday morning at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to be able to lead this conversation, especially because I think security &#8211; especially practical solutions &#8211; is woefully under-represented in social media discussion. It&#8217;s my hope that we can raise awareness of these issues, identify where the biggest problems lie, and start sorting out how to address them.</p>

<p>I am told the Core Conversations will suck less this year. Last year it was often hard to hear people in your group if there was a raucous group next to yours. This year each group should have their own room, which will be a lot better, I think.</p>

<p>Hope to <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/core_conversations?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901250">see you there</a>!</p>
