<p>I have these five promo codes from Dreamhost. They expire in three days. Apparently you get super-hot deals with them, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Four times the normal disk and bandwidth</li>
<li>$150 off a 5-year plan</li>
<li>$200 off a 10-year plan</li>
</ul>

<p>I would not sign up for 5 years with any shared host. However, I do think DH is pretty decent for small-ish sites that can work with shared hosting. I&#8217;m well aware that they&#8217;ve had a couple embarrassing public flubs in the past couple years, but I generally think they&#8217;re good folks who try to do right by their customers. Some will certainly disagree, of course. 8)</p>

<p>I still maintain my old account there for low-cpu, high-bandwidth/storage stuff. They do quite well with PHP hosting, and can handle Ruby and Python setups with a little effort. They&#8217;ll let you do crazy stuff like compile your own PHP if you are fine with using FastCGI, and have a nice GUI to setup SVN repos. Not many shared hosts will do the same at a similar price point.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the codes. They&#8217;re first come, first serve. Yes, I make money if you sign up with one of them. I will not be hurt if you don&#8217;t use them.</p>

<ul>
<li>998942362256</li>
<li>916860787004</li>
<li>591140700044</li>
<li>047271781406</li>
<li>160643597831</li>
</ul>
