This adds a 2-minute auto refresh of the currently displayed timeline, and fixes a high CPU usage bug. Unfortunately, this latter is also a bit of a regression, as the cause of the high CPU usage helped Spaz handle loading and painting userpics more quickly. Hopefully I can improve this in later releases.</p>

<p>Speaking of later releases, I&#8217;m giving serious consideration to rewriting Spaz using the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe Integrated Runtime</a> (AIR, previously Apollo). There&#8217;s a great deal of appeal in utilizing web development and design skills to create desktop apps. <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Adobe&#8217;s Spry javascript framework</a> has <em>excellent</em> data handling tools, beyond what most other JS frameworks offer: you can use arbitrary XML, JSON, or even HTML as a data source.  Combining that with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/AIR:Dreamweaver_CS3_Extension">Dreamweaver AIR extension</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/spry/">DW CS3 Spry integration</a>, and there is some real power to rapidly develop RIAs without having to learn new tools and languages.</p>
