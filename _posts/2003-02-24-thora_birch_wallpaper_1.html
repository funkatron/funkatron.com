<p><img src="//funkatron.com/blog/images/thora_wallpaper1_thumb.jpg" height="160" width="200" align="right" border="1" alt="Achtung!" />This is the first in what I hope to be a series of wallpapers featuring Thora Birch.  This particular one is based on a promo shot from Ghost World.  She was terribly cute in that film; those glasses are so nerd-sexy.  Zow!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Came here from MacUpdate.  I&#8217;m going to check out LameBrain.  Was glad to see the Thora Birch wallpaper!  Ghost World was one of the only DVDs that was worthy enough for me to purchase. She was terribly cute in that flick!  Also, your website looks like mine.  We use the same MovableType style sheet it looks.  Yours is more modified though.</p>
