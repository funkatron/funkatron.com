<p>This year, while doing taxes, I put together numbers on the <a href="http://twitter.com/spaz/status/27732358526402560">out-of-pocket costs for maintaining Spaz</a>. These include VPSes on <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8e904a2b6e8cf17be5654da4d81432ddf0cd82d6">Linode</a> and Rackspace, and paid accounts on <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com">lighthouseapp.com</a>. As I posted on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since folks were asking, I received $353.84 in donations in 2010 vs the ~$1700.00 expenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve never deluded myself into thinking the Spaz Project was even a break-even proposition: I make enough money in my day job to put some into Spaz, and I never expected to get it back.  It&#8217;s fulfilling for me and worth the investment to provide a transparent, open option for microblogging users.</p>

<p>Still, many folks in the webOS community have encouraged me to consider putting out a pay-for version of Spaz that people can purchase as a way to support the project. I wasn&#8217;t really comfortable with just putting out an identical product like that, but I think I came up with a reasonable value-add: additional themes.</p>

<p>Most users don&#8217;t really care about additional themes in an app, but some people LOVE them. I&#8217;m one of those people. I&#8217;ve always intended to put out Spaz with multiple themes, but work on adding features and improving performance have had higher priority, so I never got around to implementing it.</p>

<p>Recently I finally finished up the theme switching code, and was able to create a new theme. I informally put out a beta with this theme, called &#8220;Clean.&#8221; I also received a theme from Spaz contributor <a href="http://twitter.com/tibfib">Will Honey</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/techjunky79">Bee Rad</a> that mirrors the look of his awesome new audio app <a href="http://kotoplayer.com/">Koto Player</a>.</p>

<p>So, my idea is to release a Spaz webOS &#8220;Special Edition&#8221; with at least 5 new themes (so 6 total, including the default &#8220;Dreadnaught&#8221; theme). This would be a pay-for download in the app catalog, probably for $2-3. Note that motivated individuals <em>would</em> be able to download and integrate themes themselves if they so desire, and all contributed themes in the Special Edition would be under a liberal license that&#8217;s compatible with Spaz&#8217;s &#8220;New BSD&#8221; license.</p>

<p>In addition, I will donate 50% of the revenue from the Spaz webOS Special Edition to <a href="http://twitter.com/webosinternals">@webosinternals</a>. Their tireless work has made the webOS developer community the most open, transparent, and <em>fun</em> in mobile dev. We need to support them so they can continue to be awesome.</p>

<p>One issue that will come up with having multiple versions of Spaz is cross-app launching integration. Apps in the catalog must have unique IDs, so the Special Edition will have a different appid than the &#8220;regular&#8221; Spaz. I&#8217;ll probably put out a simple code snippet that checks for each one, so app devs don&#8217;t have to manually try to support all three &#8212; that would suck.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would pay for your Spaz WebOS app and I usually don&#8217;t for most apps if I can get them for free. But, in this case, it would be worth it.</p>

<p>I like the interface and especially the URL and text shortening API&#8217;s. I also use your PC Spaz version as I don&#8217;t like twitter&#8217;s interface very much either.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and I will look if and when a paid version rolls out.</p>

<p>As for your security question. In what base?</p>

<p>Not sure what &#8220;security&#8221; question you mean.</p>
