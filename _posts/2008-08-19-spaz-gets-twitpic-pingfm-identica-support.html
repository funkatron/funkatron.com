<p>It&#8217;s been many months since I&#8217;ve posted about <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Spaz</a> here, but I&#8217;ve actually still been working on it quite a bit. Spaz recently had its 1 year anniversary, which is a pretty good milestone for one of my projects &#8211;&#160;I usually lose interest well before this. Not only is Spaz one of the oldest <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> desktop clients still under development, but it&#8217;s also one of the few FOSS clients.  I also believe Spaz is one of the most sophisticated <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/develop/ajax/">AIR HTML</a> apps out there, and is a good example of what can be done with HTML and JavaScript on the desktop.</p>

<p>The newest release of Spaz, which came out a couple days ago, adds some significant new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Image uploading via <a href="http://twitpic.com/" title="Twitpic.com">Twitpic.com</a></li>
<li>Crossposting support via <a href="http://ping.fm">Ping.fm</a>. Try beta code &#8220;vivalaping&#8221;</li>
<li>Support for microblogging services with Twitter-compatible APIs, including <a href="http://Identi.ca">Identi.ca</a></li>
<li>A Dock icon badge with the unread message count. This is probably less significant if you are not running OS X.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read <a href="http://funkatron.com/apps/spaz/AIR/whatsnew.html">the whole fat list of what&#8217;s new</a>. Also, if you want to talk to other users or <strong>help with development</strong>, here are some resources:</p>
