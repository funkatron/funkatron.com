I&#8217;m not dead &#8212; I&#8217;m just busy.  Spaz has had a few long-standing issues since the upgrade to AIR Beta 2, and this new version (0.3.0) fixes many of them. If you already have Spaz, just go to the Prefs tab > Upgrades > Check Now. If you don&#8217;t have Spaz installed, you can install it from <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">the Spaz homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what&#8217;s new in 0.3.0:</p>

<p>3.0 (2007-10-30)</p>

<ul>
<li>All timelines now retrieve all data, not just from last 24 hours (including DMs, @s, sent messages, followers/following lists)</li>
<li>New theme: &#8220;Dumb Terminal.&#8221; Works best on Windows with Bistream Vera Sans Mono or Iconsolata font; OS X has readable mono fonts by default</li>
<li>New window behaviors: Minimize to systray (on by default), minimize when in background, restore when in foreground</li>
<li>Added Native Shell Menus under OS X</li>
<li>Added System Tray Icon in Windows w/ context menu</li>
<li>Added Dock item menu</li>
<li>User-defined CSS tweaks file now works again</li>
<li>Tweets can now be &#8220;selected.&#8221; Hit &#8216;@&#8217; (SHIFT+2) to send reply to selected tweet&#8217;s user</li>
<li>Prefs that require restart to be applied are now indicated</li>
<li>Better descriptions of data retrieval errors; should properly determine if response timed out or if request limit is exceeded</li>
<li>Fixed charcount to reset properly after successful send</li>
<li>Added simple DOM context menus - currently allow user to copy URLs to clipboard</li>
<li>Use &#8216;-khtml-user-select&#8217; to limit selectability of elements; should eliminate many problems with onlick operations</li>
<li>Popup panels should work a bit better; center properly and drag more easily. Popup panels will be moved to modal windows soon</li>
<li>Upgraded to jQuery 1.2.1</li>
<li>Dumped Interface lib, added jQuery.UI lib</li>
<li>Fixed size of protected post icon</li>
<li>Lots of code cleanup and refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve also created <a href="http://funkatron.com/content/UserCSS_A_Simple_Example.swf" target="_blank">a simple screencast</a> in <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a> to show off what I think is one of the coolest, most underused Spaz features: User CSS tweaks. It lets you load up your own CSS file to modify the current theme. If you don&#8217;t like the font size or a color, you can change it yourself, without having to author a whole theme.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://funkatron.com/content/UserCSS_A_Simple_Example.swf" target="_blank">Screencast: UserCSS in Spaz - a simple example</a> (Flash required)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&#8217;t record any audio with this screencast, as I didn&#8217;t have a decent mic handy.  Hope it&#8217;s still helpful!</p>
