<p>I&#8217;m really happy to announce that <a href="http://twitter.com/ronaldDevera">Ron Devera</a> has agreed to become the UI Lead for Spaz Desktop.</p>

<p>Spaz has been a very informally organized project since I began it back in spring 2007. A number of people have contributed important pieces of code, and support was primarily handled by <a href="http://twitter.com/kibitzer">@kibitzer</a> for over a year.</p>

<p>So why a title and all that? It seems like a good idea at the moment. I&#8217;ve been trying to establish more structure in the development and support efforts of Spaz to make it easier for others to contribute, including <a href="http://spaz.lighthouseapp.com">Lighthouse (development coordination)</a> and <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com">Tender (user support)</a> sites where volunteers can see who needs help and what needs to be done. Adding an &#8220;official&#8221; team member is a part of these efforts.</p>

<p>Ron is a smart, talented developer, with a diverse set of skills, and he&#8217;s demonstrated an ongoing commitment to making his contributed &#8220;Leopaz&#8221; theme very high-quality. He&#8217;s a strong JavaScript, Ruby and HTML/CSS dev, and his attention to detail has made Leopaz the strongest theme Spaz offers. I&#8217;m very excited about having him a part of the team.</p>
