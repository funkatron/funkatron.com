<p><a href="http://piqueweb.net/">PiqueWeb</a> is an awesome new podcast that Sean Coates and Paul Reinheimer are doing. I was lucky enough to be invited to join them for their most recent show, where we talked about responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open-source projects. They are great guys and always have interesting insights, so check out their podcast and <a href="http://piqueweb.net/rss">subscribe to their feed</a>!</p>
