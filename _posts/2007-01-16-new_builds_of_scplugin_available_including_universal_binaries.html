<p><a class="imagelink" href="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/screen_finder.png" title="SCPlugin screenshot"><img id="image587" src="http://funkatron.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/screen_finder.thumbnail.png" alt="SCPlugin screenshot" align="right" /></a>It appears that development of SCPlugin has resumed, despite the fact that the news page has not been updated in over two years.  The project&#8217;s <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents &amp; Files page</a> offers downloads of versions as new as December 9, 2006, including an &#8220;experimental&#8221; Universal Binary build of SCPlugin.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to test this yet, but this is certainly encouraging.</p>
