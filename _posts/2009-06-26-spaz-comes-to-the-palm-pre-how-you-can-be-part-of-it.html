<p>Folks who got the fancy lad Palm&#174; Pre&#8482; on opening day found the App Catalog chock full of superapps. One of them is Spaz, a ground-up rewrite of the award-winning desktop application I created for the Adobe AIR platform using pure HTML+JavaScript. Getting Spaz on webOS&#8482; has been a big undertaking for me, and the process has certainly had it&#8217;s ups and downs. But I&#8217;m proud of the fact that <strong>we shipped a truly open source, transparent app on the first day of a new platform</strong>.</p>

<p>But much like Spaz on the desktop, this is not a revenue generator for the project. Everyone who works on the Spaz project is a volunteer, and we rely on motivated folks to help us make cool software. It doesn&#8217;t need to be a huge commitment &#8212; even just getting involved in the discussion and coming up with ideas is a big help. But here&#8217;s where we need help the most:</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>While I intend to be the lead on Spaz for webOS&#8482; for a while, I really could use help &#8212; I&#8217;m working in my free time, and that&#8217;s pretty limited with a family and a day job. The full source code of Spaz for webOS&#8482; is <a href="http://github.com/funkatron/spaz-webos">available on GitHub</a>, and people who want to help make new features happen are encouraged to check it out.</p>

<p>Even if you&#8217;re not well-versed in webOS&#8482; coding, if you have a good JavaScript background (or don&#8217;t and are just interested in developing one), we need help to build up <a href="http://wiki.github.com/funkatron/spazcore">SpazCore</a>, our component library that drives Spaz for webOS&#8482;, and will drive <em>all</em> our projects in the future. Hacking on SpazCore requires no knowledge of webOS&#8482;.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>We have a brand new, very awesome support site at <a href="http://spaz.tenderapp.com/">http://spaz.tenderapp.com/</a> which is sponsored by the awesome folks at <a href="http://entp.com/">ENTP</a>. We need to direct people there, and we need to get involved in helping them there. We also should build up the FAQ/Knowledge base. In addition, identifying folks on Twitter who are trying Spaz or having issues and pointing them to the support site is very important.</p>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>

<p>Do you like Spaz? Why? First off, let us know &#8212; I&#8217;d like to build a repository of positive mentions like that. In addition, telling people about Spaz and encouraging them to check it out is great. Hwoever, this needs to be done in a <em>nice</em>, non-abusive, non-spammy way, and we always need to respect other applications and their developers. <strong>THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION</strong> &#8212; it&#8217;s making people aware of quality alternatives to closed, non-transparent software.</p>

<h3>Design/UI</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m an opinionated fellow and rather controlling of how the Spaz apps look, but I also know there are better designers and UX experts than me. If you&#8217;re interested in helping with design and UI work on Spaz &#8212; including additional themes &#8212; I&#8217;d love to hear your ideas.</p>

<h3>What About the Desktop?</h3>

<p>You are not forgotten. Spaz&#8217;s desktop client is long in the tooth, and we have <a href="http://wiki.github.com/funkatron/spazmk2">Big Plans for a full rewrite</a> based on SpazCore. That&#8217;s long-term though, and in the interim work is still being done on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spaz">the current Spaz codebase</a>, including adding multi-account support and improving filtering capabilities. We also intend to transition away from AIR to <a href="http://titaniumapp.com">the Titanium platform</a>.</p>

<p>So if you want to stop bitching in your Twitter account and actually <em>make</em> things better, here&#8217;s your change. <strong>Drop me a line at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;:&#115;&#x70;&#97;&#x7a;&#64;&#x66;u&#110;&#x6b;&#97;&#x74;&#114;&#x6f;n&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#115;&#x70;&#97;&#x7a;&#64;&#x66;u&#110;&#x6b;&#97;&#x74;&#114;&#x6f;n&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a></strong> and we&#8217;ll sort out the best way for you to kick ass.</p>
