<p><a href="http://jaredlouche.livejournal.com/">Jared Louche</a> from <a href="http://hydrogenbar.com">Chemlab</a> has been dropping some really cool artists in his journal, and I wanted to share them here to spread the virus and whatnot.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motorcitynix/sets/72057594121138132/">Bob Nixon</a></h3>

<p>A dirty, deadly, gorgeous mash of shlock horror, hot rods, pin-ups and two-color grime, Bob Nixon&#8217;s design work is sure to please punk, rockabilly, and horror culture fans alike.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/">Cyberoptix</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve had Deathany Shorb/Toybreaker on my Flickr contacts for a while, because she has some really great pics of run-down houses and industrial wastelands, but she also makes <a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/">AMAZING ties</a>:</p>

<p>If I ever wore ties, I&#8217;d wear hers!</p>
