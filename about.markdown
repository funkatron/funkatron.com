With his 15 years of passionate web development experience and open
source advocacy, Ed Finkler loves empowering people through
technology. He's excited about creating things and sharing them with
the world.

He served as web lead and security researcher at The Center for
Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS)
at Purdue University for 9 years. More recently, he has been helping
startup teams build exciting e-commerce, social sharing, and mapping
systems. He's a proud member of the [FictiveKin](http://fictivekin.com)
team, working on [Gimme Bar](https://gimmebar.com) and other projects.

Ed spends much of his free time creating and working on open source
projects. He created Spaz, a long-running, award winning
microblogging client. Built on open technologies like JavaScript,
HTML5 and CSS, Spaz continues to be the choice of thousands of users
who value transparency, flexibility, and strong UX. Ed also created
the PHPSecInfo auditing tool and the Inspekt input filtering library
for PHP.

With his partner Chris Hartjes, Ed records the popular [Development Hell](http://devhell.info) podcast on coding and open source culture.
